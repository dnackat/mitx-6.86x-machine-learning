1	B001RVFDOO	A3ABKJ4THITBUG	Different and yummy!	I agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options.  The texture of the chips is great and they're very flavorful!  I can certainly taste the sodium but if this isn't a problem for you, I would recommend trying them.  It's a snack I look forward to having a chance to enjoy.  Everyone has their favorite flavor (i'm no exception -BBQ FTW!) so I recommend trying the variety pack first.  I thought I'd have at least one or two flavors we'd 'hate', but no.<br /><br />My initial purchase of an alternative snack was Stacy's Pita Chips in Parmesan Garlic & Herb.  Nothing against them, but they lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.  These Popchips are exactly right.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty, flavorful snack!	0	0
-1	B007RTR9DS	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Oops, wrong hair type	I got this for my husband who's always complaining about how dry his scalp is. Unfortunately, he has straight, fine hair and is Caucasian, so this product wasn't exactly suited to his needs. It is very greasy, even when just a little is applied, and takes several washes to get it all out. I read some of the other reviews and there seems to be a consensus regarding how it's better suited to African American hair type and not so much for Caucasian hair types. One other thing is that this product contains Petrolatum.	1	0
-1	B003ZT25JM	A302EVE094JVRT	Much cheaper elsewhere	Why is this so overpriced!?!?! This product is available elsewhere on Amazon for 1/3 this price and for about $3.83/can at WalMart if you can't find it here on Amazon. Buyer beware!	2	0
-1	B001CJE4IC	A1Y34ZG94EW5CB	Spearmint gum	Your display shows only spearmint gum, but also comes with peppermint. Spearmint is the only kind that i am  looking for. Is there anywhere I can purchase the spearmint in bulk.	0	0
-1	B001E5DYM6	A32JNXID5HS1WA	Disappointed	The most I can say about this product is that it has an interesting label. I had a palm full which left a terrible bitter taste in my mouth for six hours until dinner when it started to go away. I didn't feel so good either. The pieces were very stuck together and some appeared to have very tiny pieces of leaf attached to them. I have purchased several other brands from local natural food stores with no problem whatsoever, so I figured that all would be well to order something unknown online. I also didn't want to run out of goji berries and have to pay for shipping very soon, so I ordered to two sets which totals four bags. I finished my supply from the natural food store today, and I started on the Extreme Health which is one day beyond the Amazon.com return policy. Therefore I'll have to throw in the trash about $60. LESSON: Never order any food that you're not sure about even if it has a pretty label and/or try it out before one month or you can't return it to Amazon.com.	2	0
1	B004S036IQ	AVQIRN6E7J7UA	Just want to post calorie and fat content info	One container is 240 calories and 8 grams of fat. I really would like to have known that before ordering, so I'm posting this info before even eating any.	0	1
-1	B0058AMYTC	A1WQ3UGXPT15VI	Not  Very Creamy or Chivey...	I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor.	0	0
-1	B003QKBDX4	A25TATUT0AGUJ7	"""Lightly sweet""???"	"What an aggravating product. The package label says ""lightly sweet"", which sounds perfect, and says that it makes 5 - 16 oz drinks. Checking the Nutrition Facts on the back of the package I see ""11 gms of sugar""--sounds reasonable. But when I mix up a packet per directions (in 16 oz.) it was undrinkably sweet. Taking a closer look at the fine print, I discover that although the directions are for one 16 oz. drink per packet, the Nutrition Facts are for ""SERVING SIZE 1/2 PACKET and 10 servings per package"". My 16 oz. ""lightly sweetened"" drink contains 22 GRAMS of SUGAR. The packaging is misleading twice over. What could have been a good coffee drink is ruined by our culture's addiction to sugar and corporate labeling practices."	6	4
1	B0061YK3O2	A2MC8QL3JYVHMZ	Delicious!	I use this olive oil for salads, dipping bread in it, hummus, and sauteing veggies and meat. Its a very high quality oil with a delicious taste! Try the oil by itself and compare to another olive oil and you'll see the difference! I've gotten my girlfriend and my mom both hooked on it. In addition, it has been great getting to know Nick who helps manage the production (as compared to what you buy in the store from a big brand)since he goes to the farmers markets here in Cincinnati and lets people sample the oil.<br /><br />I've only recently found how much better local veggies and other products at the farmers market can really taste, all for just a couple extra dollars. A bottle of olive oil lasts a long time so paying a couple extra dollars compared to buying another cheaper brand, is more than worth it!	1	0
-1	B0089SPENI	A12A5Q07EQK6LV	Indian Spice Chai	This is a very nice chai...doesn't taste like I thought it would..has a very strong spice taste..but still very good.	2	1
1	B000VK8HCW	A2S099BLER8VXV	Newman's Turkey and Brown rice formula	My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year. I mix it with Flint River Ranch kibble so they have some crunchy food also. They are spaniels (a breed prone to allergies) and have had no allergy problems and have shiny, sleek coats. They are healthy and love the food. I strongly recommend it. It is a high-quality, human-grade dogfood.	2	0

1	B000HDMV3E	A36MP37DITBU6F	AWESOME sweet BAR B Q chips with a very crispy hard crunch. Best BBQ chips out there.	Awesome taste, Gluten free and low in fat. What more can you ask for? If you like the harder crunchy chips these are for you. Not too spicy just a sweet barbque chip. My boys and I love them.	1	0
-1	B000YTAYMQ	A2XNJJ9TF70P4J	Gross	"I hate to be THAT person, but these are gross. Buffalo wings are one of my most favorite foods ever but these do not taste like buffalo wings. They taste really sour, then really spicy and hot, and WAY WAY WAY too salty, and I love my salt! I can't pick up a good flavor with these. I'm really sad because they sounded amazing. I recommend the ""Everything"" Pretzel Crisps."	0	0
1	B000LKXBL4	A12OF4IM7A8YS	Excellent balance of taste, crunchiness, and moisture	I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.	0	0
1	B001LG945O	A25KVM6GJBLISZ	Flavor with fizz	It's very refreshing to find products without sugar added, but make no mistake, this tiny can still packs a solid 34 grams of sugar, enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical adrenal fatigue crash.  Perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash?<br /><br />The flavor is very good and will tempt you to chug the whole can in one quick drink.  Not exactly a health drink, but it's a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink.	0	0
1	B001H03PF4	A1YOFZYI8H30X8	Amazing Chocolate	I bought this for my Girlfriend's Dad as a Christmas present and then again as a Birthday present after finding out that he had the equivalent of a dark chocolate nestle's Crunch bar, loved it, and could not find anything similar anywhere. Well, he loved this too and one day I found where he was hiding it and got to try some for myself. It really is delicious and I'm not one to ever stand up for dark chocolate. Do not be prepared to share the 1/2lb bag. If you want to share, make sure you get the bigger bag.	0	0

1	B005Z4S2KG	A3PKESR8ETDD6X	Excellent!	These are excellent lentils, from a great agricultural area. I've been to the Palouse several times, a wonderful, amazingly beautiful region of rolling green farmland in eastern Washington/northern Idaho, famous for photography, rich soil, and, well, lentils.  They even have a lentil festival every August, no kidding. When I saw these lentils on Amazon I had to try them - I belong to Amazon Prime, get free two-day shipping - and they are excellent. Like others say, they are small, firm, and really flavorful. They take more time and water to cook than most other kinds of lentils I've used due to their firmness, but retain their shape really well.  They are also chewy, not mushy, and the flavor is kind of nutty. You can do anything you want with them - make curry, soup, salad, mix them with rice or quinoa or chopped veggies, season them any way you like. I love lentils in general, other faves are red lentils (sweet and mushy, make great soup) and black lentils (tiny and round, and a great alternative to black beans) which I can get at local health food stores, but these are truly top shelf, and I've never seen them in stores. I agree with what someone else said, too, they are very clean, I haven't found any rocks or twigs in them. Just great lentils. I'm ordering a five pound bag this time so I can have them on hand for awhile - and I love knowing I'm supporting a great gem of a growing region by buying them.	1	0
1	B0029O10P4	A2DYQUFAUTO7N4	Cat's favorite treat	I've tried several brands and flavors of treats for my cat, but this is the only one she really likes. Finding the dairy flavor after we moved was difficult, and ordering from Amazon is easy and keeps a supply on hand.	0	0
1	B000FFM7UG	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Perfect Honeybush Herbal Tea	"*****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Bushmen's Brew Honeybush Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi herbal tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified honeybush. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""For hundreds of years, the Khoi and San peoples of Southern Africa hand gathered this plant from the mountainous regions of their homelands. This honey scented flowering bush creates an enticing rich brew with sweet honey over-tones. Rich in anti-oxidants, phytoestrogens and essential minerals, this new, organic African herbal is both delicious and healthy. One sip and the secret touches your soul."" It is naturally sweet (but not too sweet) and delicious.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love herbal teas or honeybush in particular, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****"	2	0
-1	B000HAJZM2	ADD3MVXKVIFE7	Fixes one problem, creates new ones	I used to buy the Friskies dental diet for my four year old feline, who had severe gingivitis, resulting in terrible breath and tooth decay. The Friskie's, for being a cheap brand, actually did a pretty good job of improving this condition, since she refuses to let me brush. However, they took this food off the market. The remaining 2 options are this food and Hill's.<br /><br />Finding this online with the free shipping and the cheaper price sealed the deal for me, as they don't usually have it in the store, and her oral condition was deteriorating again. I had been feeding her a hairball and healthy weight formula just because it was what my other cat ate in the meantime, and was happy to have a new dental food.<br /><br />After slowly switching her over, I realized this food really isn't as good as it seems. It mildly improved her teeth, but her breath is still awful and I can see tartar (compared to the improvement I saw from the Friskie's). She now has started coughing up hairballs almost every other day, and she is gaining weight rapidly, even though I feed her less than a cup a day. She also acts hungry all the time. I checked the amount of fat in this food, and it is almost double the healthy weight formula. So I can feed her a normal amount and she will continue to get fatter (been on it for about 3 months, and has gained at least 2 pounds) or I can starve her so she maintains a normal weight. I recommend checking the nutrition or even trying the Hill's if your cat has severe gum/tooth disease, weight issues, or hairball problems. The other reviewers gave it favorable ratings, however, so maybe if your cat has mild problems it will work for you.	2	0

-1	B00125ZCWI	A2TMTQVLROY5RI	I am not sure if it has helped me	I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.	0	0

1	B0061IUKDM	A2ZJPDH0YP90SD	Elegant	This is a very light, naturally sweet green tea.  I add stevia to mine because I really like sweetened tea and that makes it perfect.  Each tea bag is wrapped in a lovely black and green foil bag.  There are hints of lemongrass and verbena, but they are very subtle.  The tea has a remotely fresh smell, a bit like young bamboo.  An absolutely relaxing and enjoyable experience in each cup.  When three o'clock comes round at work you will find me brewing a nice cuppa!	0	0
-1	B004T7YXSA	A3NA8KJQ9GW8L9	Stale Taste, Flavoring Coats the Tongue	I make kale chips at home on a regular basis but wanted to give these a try for flavor inspiration. I opened the bag and a nice scent of BBQ wafted out. So, I pop a piece into my mouth...and while it tasted indeed like BBQ, there was also a distinct stale flavor and the powder flavoring actually coated my tongue - I could have been eating a BBQ-flavored cardboard chip for the lack of kale flavor. They have a heavy feel and do not resemble kale much at all - I was really disappointed. Back to making them myself.	3	1
1	B000EZOOZS	A2UW73HU9UMOTY	Healthy great tasting jerky	I just finished an 8 pack I ordered and just wanted to say this is the best jerky on the market. It has great flavor and it's very healthy. I definitely recommend!!	0	0

1	B0012XBD7I	A2TMSO255FQBBU	Some of the best chips anywhere	Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.

1	B0009JMW1C	A15ZLXABTK8F3F	THIS PRODUCT WORKS!	Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.	1	0
1	B000TK6LBS	A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5	Go Caribou!	OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school librarian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K-Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee-fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm brewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the librarian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the librarian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?  Thanks, Keurig, for making Caribou a part of my daily life!	1	0

1	B002AUF0UI	A1YNH4D1KWNZK7	GF & Delicious	Oatmeal is gluten free and we should be able to just grab any brand we like and be okay with it, but having a food allergy is never that simple, knowing that an item that is GF by itself does not mean safe to eat, since oats are exposed to crosscontamination while being processed, so having a brand that is certified GF is great! plus the flavors are delicious, especially the raisin one!	0	0

1	B000EZMRQ6	A1BUJYNUW9FEUI	The Real Stuff	This is the best commercially available beef jerky around. It's drier than most products out there (Pemican, Jack Daniels) and much more authentic. Sadly, it seems that Trader Joe's has stopped carying it and started using their own, inferior brand. Honestly, it'g going to reduce the number of trips I make to trader joe's by 1/2. Anyway, if you like authentic beef jerkey (like the kind you used to find in the glass jars at gas stations) this is the only brand for you!	1	0
1	B000CMHMUC	AFFJQGNCDIZG3	Crunchy, no-guilt snack	I am a huge fan of Genisoy Soy Crisps (Deep Sea Salted flavor).<br />I love the crunch and texture of this non-greasy snack.  The flavor is subtle and very light.  No heavy salty taste or greasy lips or fingers after eating.  I also like that I can really indulge on these and not feel the regret of eating too many calories.  Soy Crisps are my fav crunchy treat.  >^,,^&lt;	0	0
1	B000RI3SKY	A2ZKF3UU1TF14L	Miraculous	Two of my middle-aged cats have shown signs of stiffness in one of their hind legs. I decided to give them Cosequin, a highly recommended supplement for joint health in cats and dogs.<br /><br />One of my cats is a pig and will eat anything that's not nailed down, so I knew giving him the supplement would be a fairly easy process; however, the other cat is very picky and will only eat dry food (he's not even interested in cat treats), so I was concerned that giving him the Cosequin would be an impossible task.<br /><br />Enter Greenies Pill Pockets (chicken flavored). Skittles (the finicky cat) went nuts the second I introduced them. I stuck a capsule inside a Pill Pocket and he snarfed it down at top speed, then started looking for more. And it's been that way ever since. For the first time ever, my cats actually look forward to getting their medication every day! (In fact, the other two cats who aren't receiving medication try to sneak a Pill Pocket every now and then.)<br /><br />The only thing I would caution is that the pockets are fairly small. Cosequin capsules, for example, can be opened and sprinkled on food or into a pocket -- but it took about three pockets to hold one capsule's worth of powder. Thus, I've had to keep the capsule intact, pushing it through the pocket so that it sticks out on both ends. That said, my cats still inhale it like it's the best thing they've ever tasted.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all cat families. This product works miracles.	1	0
-1	B002ZOCERQ	A2DKRUR8M5WIAC	Inconsistent flavor.	I do enjoy the Hazelnut variant of this coffee when the flavor is on point... However, I've run into quite a few bags where the coffee flavor is off. Bitter would be more like it. The flavor inconsistency has become a problem in the last 6 or so months for me. I hold my breath when I go to the stores to buy it now. I may do as someone suggested and try the whole bean.	0	0

Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, don't buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title	0	3

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"	1	2
1	B000GG0BNY	A36A1ZYZH8568P	My Wife Loves Almost All Bigelow Teas	"Okay, we admit it: we're neither coffee nor tea snobs. In fact, I won't drink tea - real or fake made out of some weird flowers. But every night I make my wife a cup of tea with her dinner. For the past 5 years, I've been using ""real"" tea from a ""gourmet"" tea vendor on line. Great stuff that my wife really liked. The leaves were shredded, not pulverized, and one needed a ... ? tea cozy to put the tea in in order to let it steep. Well, our supplier went out of business, and I ordered four different kinds of Bigelow tea including this orange and spice. She loves it, and I've got to say that just heating a cup of water and throwing in a tea bag makes my minor chore minorer. And she can regulate the strength without timing it for 2-5 minutes or whatever.<br /><br />She particularly likes this and the raspberry, and I have to admit I like the aroma that fills our small kitchen. You may not go for this is you are a tea snob, but Earl Grey will suit you fine and I daresay that few people would be able to tell the difference."	1	0
1	B000GQTP1S	A2Z7XYKJCZCB1W	Hottest on earth	I am a hot food junkie and found these chips at a local grocery store.  I got addicted and kept searching for them again and again, but they must have been on a trial run, never to return.  Amazon fortunately had them, but in palette sized orders rather than a couple bags.  Oh well.  This is simply the most nuclear, face napalm, gastro grenading potato chip I have ever had.  If you're a sadistic snack aficionado like me, try these.  A half bag into it, you will be paying the price.	0	0

I didn't check the product description well enough to notice it.  Even broken up into bits, my boys leave them sit.  I guess it's back to jerky made for humans, so that I have a little USDA inspecting to make sure it's not Chinese poison.	0	0

Another complaint is that it's mostly filled with  GARLIC!, and barely any lemon peels. Once you open the container, it smell dramatically like garlic powder, no lemon scent at all!!! Your basically buying garlic powder. I felt conned.. =(	0	1
-1	B0060Q4HAW	ANDMAQLCTLJ1O	No Winny on this Skinny	I happen to LOVE Skinny Girl margaritas, so when our Safeway was out of them I naturally grabbed a bottle of her White Cranberry Cosmo...big disappointment!

Never again!	1	0
1	B004TJD758	A25AZWQRGZPK4A	My first Amazing Grass product	I really like this Superfood, but this is the only amazing grass product I have tried. If it doesn't dissolve really well, it can be a bit sweet. I've discovered that it dissolves really well in soy milk, but not almond or coconut milk. I also love the way it makes me feel. I'm gonna try some more of the flavors.<br /><br />Also, this is one of the amazing grass products that is not organic. Most are; this one isn't.	0	0
1	B001KY0960	A3UH23DXRWTL0W	StarKist Albacore Tuna is the best!	Best Tasting and Best Quality by far. Make the best Tuna Patties. Great Cold on Salads too. We have never found a better substitute.	1	2
1	B005MWAM72	AN0U0GNJJPEUR	my favorite flavor	Instant oatmeal is my go-to breakfast whenever I have to work the very early morning shift.  I just pour the packet into a mug and add hot water from the dispenser on the coffee maker.  Quaker's Maple Brown Sugar is pretty good, but I think the Safeway brand is just a little tastier.  Quaker's version just doesn't have quite enough brown sugar in my opinion.  Since I had a box of Safeway's, I decided to compare.  They're pretty similar with the same calories and grams of fat, but when it comes to nutrients the Safeway version is slightly more nutritious.  For example, Quaker has 15% Vitamin A and 8% Calcium while Safeway has 20% Vitamin A and 10% Calcium.  Going down the list, Safeway is either equal to or better in each category.	0	0

I had heard that it was a premium vodka so I decided to give it a chance and live it up for the night.  The taste when one drinks it straight is comparable to that of grey goose.  So after that trial I think I will save the money and buy grey goose or belvedere.	1	2

-1	B001DTMLTK	A3V6XX4DUQQS59	Meat on the internet??	Back in my days you had to get to a store at 3 am and wait until they open so you can get food on your table. This was Poland 20 years ago. Now I came to America and... you can buy raw meat... on the internet... I don't want to live on this planet anymore...	1	10
-1	B007JFMH96	A3A2NL6CDH3GWN	For specific times and specific reasons.....maybe.	So far four of the people in my family who have tried these cookies have not liked them enough for me to buy them.  I'm really glad I got to try a sample before I was tempted in the grocery store because Quaker is one of my favorite brand names.<br /><br />The fact that they are portion controlled in a single-cookie-pouch is a plus if you want to make it harder on yourself to *accidentally* overeat sweet cookies.  Each cookie is 180 calories.<br /><br />If you want to have something to pack in a lunch box or stash in a drawer at the office, these will remain fresh for quite a while.  My box has an October 25, 2012 best-used-by date -- about three months at least.<br /><br />Of the six packets in the box, four cookies were whole and two were broken.  The cookie is soft but very dry which was interesting because the chocolate chunks melt on contact with your fingers.  The chocolate was soft, the almond pieces were firm, and the whole oat grains were slightly tough.  My first impression was dry with a sawdust-like texture.<br /><br />Overall, I would suggest having this treat with something liquid - coffee, hot tea, milk.  It actually does look like a fresh home baked cookie so it is attractive to the eye.  The chocolate chunks and almond pieces were large enough to be easily identifiable and the cookie was not overly sweet, just enough to satisfy a craving for something to treat yourself with.  This product will not be a favorite with my family, but I can certainly see where they would be convenient for specific reasons and at specific times.	0	0
1	B007RTR8AM	A27O5ZUFAEWT9L	Good, But Nothing Special	This shampoo cleans well and leaves your hair soft, but I can't discern any difference between this and most other shampoos on the market.  It has a light, pleasant scent -- not too perfumey -- and it lathers well.  I would use it again, but it's nothing to get super-excited about.  Regarding the claim about getting your hair stronger in seven days, I honestly can't say I noticed that.	0	0

1	B000RYBDLE	AXDTSURVYXH3O	Incredibly delicious dressing	My co-worker, who is from Hawaii, introduced me to this delicious dressing.  I add it to my salad and somen noodles, and I have a quick Asian noodle salad.  I have served this salad to my many friends, and it always get rave reviews.  It is, by far, my favorite dressing.	0	0
-1	B0041NYV8E	A3AZI828WJN1CD	strong ginger, weak lemon, sweet	The gold kili mixed easily, no clumps in my cup of hot liquid. The smell was very nice, although I could really only pick up the ginger.<br /><br />Sipping, the ginger hit me first. In fact, the beverage tasted of ginger and sweet. There didn't seem to be a balance between ginger and lemon. Eventually I picked up a very odd lemon taste, sort of like when I sprayed lemon pledge and accidentally inhaled, it doesn't so much taste lemony as vaguely lemon chemical. Heavy ginger, very sweet, not for me.<br /><br />I think I'd rather squeeze my own lemon, toss in a slice of ginger and a bit of honey in a cup of hot water. Between the way to sweet and the fake chemical lemon aftertaste, this is not my cup of beverage.	0	0

-1	B000FFIL92	A12NHIJ6GMU2MV	tea pot and tea	I have enjoyed the glass teapot, and even the packaging, but the tea flowers did not have hardly any flavor... the first time I tried a tea posy it was wonderful, but with these, just not enough flavor.	0	0
-1	B000OZP7CM	APVAYU1AHYC7	Price too good to be true...	If the price looks too good, it probably is!!  How in the world are you supposed to get the coconut oil out of this plastic jug??  Right now it's a solid jug of useless coconut oil.  I guess I'll try warming it up slightly in lukewarm water, and then store it in glass containers, but don't hold out very high hopes that I can do this without having a ton of plastic tainted oil.	0	6
-1	B003CIE7WE	A25PBN571WCB33	saffron	The saffron was not worh it to me. To receive such a small amount for the price means you get very little benefit. Also, because of how it is packaged, when you try to pour some out, it ALL comes out. Therefore, in my opinion, it is not worth the money.	0	1
-1	B000FA395I	A2APHQA8UQTV0	My taste buds were overloaded after having just 2 cookies	With all the talk of Snackwells being low in sugar, their cookies seem to be a little sweet on the flavoring side. I had several of these as a midday snack and my tongue didn't recover until early the next morning the things are so sweet. Don't munch on these before bed either, I guarantee you will up at least until the wee hours of the morning.	0	13
1	B001P3NU30	A6QDGXFKNXQE6	My dogs request - CET Enzymatic Chews!	I used to buy those real-animal pieces from the pet store.  They kept my dogs' teeth really clean, but the smell was more than I could bear. The CET Chews are SO much better.  The dogs love them and no smell from the dogs :-) or the chews. We buy a case at a time so we never run out.	0	0
-1	B007JFMH96	A1BA72K4VK1UN1	Okay but not the bomb.	I had high expectations for these cookies but they weren't quite as good as I anticipated.<br /><br />They are very chewy and fresh-tasting -- that's the good news. But they're not exactly bursting with flavor and, as moist as they seem to the touch, they tasted dry as I ate them. My wife said the same, unprompted. I tried them with black coffee and they're just a bit gluey as you munch.<br /><br />If you want chocolate, this would not be a great choice. If you want something more akin to the mild taste of a scone, these individually-wrapped cookies would be okay if you don't mind the dryness.	0	0
-1	B001FZ0SY2	A38GQZIJ9511I9	NOT long lasting	I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though.	1	0
-1	B0013A0QXC	A25EE3X3GQ6M7L	Not Bad, But There are Better	As the popularity of the Senseo pod system wanes and that of the Keurig system grows, there is diminished availability of pods that fit the Senseo. The Senseo brand pods are available on Amazon at a decent price. Unfortunately, the Senseo pods are not as good as competing brands formerly available on Amazon such as Fratello, Halo, Millstone, etc. Of the Senseo pods, the French Roast has a richer flavor than most of the others. It is often on sale and is a bargain when that happens. I suspect that the Keurig system makes good coffee, but I cannot imagine paying so much for a Keurig pod (thimble).	10	3
-1	B000E4C2LW	A2UPHSOT21EGLI	Allergy warning	Great product. However,beware if you have food allergies.  These products are made in a facility with other foods so they can be contaminated and you can have an allergic reaction (like I did).  Allergy sufferers beware!!	0	0

1	B001BOVE54	A19DHLAKJOAVN0	best dry food	This food is hands down amazing. My cats LOVE it. Healthy food is no good if they won't eat it, but this they love. Even more important my cats absolutely thrive on this food. The cats have sensitive stomachs but do really well on this food. No problems when they are on this. I feed wet food but some dry when I am at work and this food is so so great for my cats. Improves their fur, energy and general health. Fair warning, your cat might hate it. The only cat food that can fairly safely be predicated to be loved by most cats is fancy feast. But my cats adore this.	0	0

1	B001ZXJ8P4	A2TL2Z439Y9YEP	The best raw hide bone	"These rawhides are great!<br /><br />It is really hard to find rawhides that are made in America using American cows. It really does matter where they are made because the US has laws against using formaldehyde and other deadly preservatives in products meant for pet consumption.<br /><br />If your pet is a heavy chewer and goes through rawhides like candy, then they could be consuming harmful amounts of poisonous stuff.<br /><br />This article does a great job discussing the topic:<br />[...]<br /><br />These Rawhides are made by Pet Factory in Illinois. They are talked about in the article as being great quality rawhides but they go on to say that the company does not sell directly to the public so they are really hard to find.<br /><br />But here they are!!<br /><br />They are really thick and last a very long time. They are a great value too. Petco makes a ""Retriever Roll"" for $5 each that are of lesser quality than these Pet Factory ones.<br /><br />I order 10 at a time though and when I first open that box, the smell is pretty gnarly; which is exactly how natural rawhide is supposed to be. Just open the box outside and let them air out a bit before bringing them inside and everything is fine."	0	0

1	B0078UZH6W	A3CFM008T8ZZG5	Without Question, The Best Honey I Ever Tasted!	"I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey, and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead brewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this, I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark, rich honey without the ""hay taste"" of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all, having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff, and kept going back for more.  I have my mead brewing (6 1/2 gallons), and the brewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead, which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!"	0	0
1	B001EOMQ9E	AJ2DU4JFF2DYT	Delicious, don't let packaging fool you	If you see this stuff on a store shelf you might be put off by the color, that's because it's not loaded down with dye to keep it bright. Don't let the garish packaging fool you either, El Yucateco as a brand is excellent.  This sauce is excellent, flavorful and hot without the acidic sharp burning that sauces heated with extract will have.<br /><br />It's difficult to say how hot it is, since that's so subjectivve. I consider myself pretty well versed in hot foods and to me this isn't uncomfortably hot by a long stretch, it's exactly the kind of thing i'd dollop on tacos without a care in the world.	4	0

1	B001BCVY9W	A20J0NBT6FWXXM	excellent quality	This is, at $1 a can, the most expensive cat food that I've purchased.  It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given.	0	1
1	B002866FSU	A2UXX5DM5PHUAP	Don't eat too many!	These are good-tasting, as advertised.  My one caution would be don't eat too many a day, or at least space it out with something binding.	1	0

Fortunately, the bottles were all intact..	3	0

-1	B004FD5NDM	A3W18D5YN7NGGD	My cookie monster thought they tasted odd	"I'm married to a 40 year old cookie monster - he has rarely met a cookie he didn't like.  Unfortunately - these cookies were ones that he didn't like.  They have a strange flavor to them... they have that undercooked taste to make them ""soft"" but that isn't the strange flavor.  I am not one that really enjoys that undercooked taste but there is still an off flavor to these cookies, most noticed in the snickerdoodle variety but still evident over the chocolate in the chocolate chip cookie.  Chocolate usually covers all problems, but not with this cookie.  My cookie monster recomends that you purchase a different cookie gift as these were veery disappointing."	0	1

-1	B0002YW26E	A21Q5YZFQQ62YG	JUST SAY NO	Boy, did this sound like a great product.  We have a problem with roaches in our apartment and we wanted to give this a shot and avoid combat.  Bought a pack and were amazed at how quickly they were filled.  We had no idea we had so many roaches!<br />So after 3 mos or whatever, we were still having roach problems, so we bought more.  We were interested in how many roaches seemed to be HATCHING in the traps.  Gross, right?  We never had so many roaches.<br />So guess what.  We threw the traps away.  And away went the roaches.<br />We've checked everywhere, and they just seem to be gone.<br />The pheromones were ATTRACTING roaches to my apartment.  We had roaches, yes, but not the infestation we ended up with after using these things!  They seriously are a roach magnet, roaches will come from everywhere to get near them, hatch more babies in your home/apartment, and then you'll need to buy more roach magnets!  Amazing.<br />And gross.<br />Just don't do it.  This is a waste of money and will make your house unsafe with roaches, roach poop, you name it.<br />Totally gross.	69	8

-1	B001HTISRU	A1DZK7M8ZK4JZQ	Will never buy again...	I'm afraid, after reading the other reviews, that perhaps I may have purchased a 'bad batch' or something (I purchased from Costco like one of the other reviewers) as I absolutely did not like this product at all.<br /><br />I love quinoa, brown rice & quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course. The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. I normally expect packaging to be misleading but in the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this.	1	4
-1	B0046GRD0O	AKEWAQNGZBBFJ	Good, not great	Very grainy and solid, which I had not anticipated. I thought it would be smoother. Tastes good but the grainy product is a slight turnoff for me.	0	0

-1	B000WFEN74	A3QQ79KZMECRJ9	Better than most canned food but still BAD	"I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called ""acceptable"" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is ""Turkey"", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and ""flavoring"" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star."	1	0
1	B000GZU7SY	A1I82T8CMZSQYZ	Love the Low Salt	The beans taste good.  I like that the cans are BPA free and that the beans are very low in sodium.  My local supermarket doesn't sell low sodium beans.	1	0

1	B004HCBKJ2	A26R20G1J6SBLV	Decent quality, Decent price	In anticipation of receiving these peppers I purchased a couple single peppers from a friend and ate them whole to gauge the spiciness. The separate peppers that I purchased were extremely spicy, leaving me in agony for at least 20 minutes each, and making me feel sick for the rest of the day (that was the desired effect). After getting these peppers I gave a few away and ate a couple and found that they were significantly lower in their spiciness; though not disappointingly so. The packaging also gives the idea that they were a few years old and some of them seemed to be fallen apart or shriveled up. Overall, they were spicy and came with the amount advertised.	0	0
1	B004LL34Y8	A8FZ0BTJO5OT	Allegro Orginal Marinade	This marinade is out of this world. I won't use anything else on my brisket. Picking up more today to try on a roast. I haven't found any product better than this. It's a bit on the extravagant side, but so worth it. You won't be disappointed. Now that I know they have new products, may try those. (Yes they have a new brisket sauce. I'll still use this on my brisket. Can't go wrong with perfection. Brisket recipe: Take a brisket with a nice slab of fat over it (you can take it off later) not too thick not too thin (you need this for keeping the meat moist and tender). Pour 1-2 bottles over the brisket (depends on the size) in a deep roasting pan (I use an enamel pan)deep enough to be able to put a piece of foil over the top without touching the brisket. Seal the edges of the foil around the pan to make a tent. Put in the oven at 250-275 degrees for a few hours. ( Frozen brisket is even better) if frozen, then cook longer (at least double time) You can check it from time to time. Watch out for the steam when you roll back a corner/side. Check with a fork to see if it starts to flake, taste it, you'll know if it's done. This will be the flaky, moistest brisket you ever ate. (skim off the fat and throw away). S-l-o-w cooking is the way to go with brisket. This marinade is what makes it sooooo good.	0	0

I've tried other superfoods and couldn't get them down, so it was a waste of money and we were still not getting the nutrition we needed, but this is perfect.

-1	B0030VJ9K8	A2EP2E4UMM19LC	Try Before You Buy in Bulk	My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!	0	0
1	B001GIK7OE	A12LTYDEZDUEIV	excellent beans for espresso or flavored specialties	"I own two super automatics (Capresso and Gaggia) and a separate Kitchen Aid drip coffee machine.  My wife and I drink at least two cups per day and host weekly gatherings of about a dozen people.<br /><br />After trying majority of the Starbucks, illy, Lavazza, and the beans at Costco, we have finally found a winner and now order three 2.2lb beans to last about 6 months per order.<br /><br />These beans have just the right ""intensity"" in the flavor to make this perfect for the espresso drinkers to the more demanding latte perfectionists and the sweet Caramel Macchiato drinkers like myself.  Tastes consistently good with all three of my machines unlike the burnt taste of Starbucks.<br /><br />Strongly recommended, but I must warn you that this could be addictive!"	0	0
1	B006N3I84I	A1J2RVQ0NG7JSX	Favorite so far	Delicious. Good and strong but slightly less bitterness than Tully's French roast. Out of all the dark roasts, this is the best K-Cup I've had yet. Just hoping these things get a little cheaper now that the patent's up!	0	0
1	B001ELL3DM	A2VBL3JMMB282U	The Best	We like this cereal so much that we have subscribed.  Now we not only enjoy this cereal but we save money.  By subscribing to a monthly delivery (I sound like a commercial, don't I) we save 70 cents a box from what it cost at our local grocer and then that's only when we can find it on his shelf which isn't often enough.  So it comes to our door for less.  It tastes so good and is truly healthful.	1	0
-1	B000KV7ZGQ	A1JL5ZJYDBNY9V	Wish they hadn't changed this toy	I originally purchased this item back in March of last year.  It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day.  This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug.  After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I then purchased a replacement end of last year.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one.  This toy lasted about 15 minutes before my dog had completely chewed through it, making the toy nearly useless.<br /><br />5 stars for the original version, 1 for new and unimproved.	3	2

They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.	3	3

1	B001ELJKDC	AJUUENFSO08YZ	Best Wine Kit I've tried!	I have been making wine for just under a year. This is my fourth kit. I tried the other cheaper cabernet merlot 4 week kit sold on Amazon and was not very happy. So I decided to spend a little more money and see if there was a big difference. The directions were a little off but I've done this enough times now including making wine from fruit that I had a pretty good idea of the order of things. I did the full six weeks. I did not filter. I racked once at about 5 weeks and 2 times before bottling. It made 29 bottles plus enough to fill 2/3 of one. I put the 2/3 full bottle in a bottle I had with a screw top and kept it on the stove for the past 2 weeks thinking I might use it to cook. I poured myself a glass last night and neither my husband nor I could believe it! It was SO SMOOTH! It had great body. It was perfectly CABERNET like I was looking for all along! If I had filtered it might have a little better clarity than it does, but it really doesn't seem to be affecting the taste. I am so impressed with this brand I setting it up for automatic delivery. I also am going to try their Pinot Noir next and hope for the same results. If you like dry and smooth, this is the wine for you to make!	4	0

The first time I tasted rose jam, I was in Vancouver, BC.  It was served on buttery vanilla scones.  I knew I had to take some home with me.  Since then, I've tried 2 other brands.  The Kafka is quite good and actually has real bits of rose petals in it which really boosts that sweet flowery flavor in your mouth.  It has just the right amount of sweetness too.  My only beef is, I found them at my local imports store for only $3.89.  I spent nearly $15 ordering them from Amazon.	2	0

1	B0016687F2	A3TD3QYRSW624N	shake diet	Okay, I bought this product to do a shake diet. Instead of two scopes, I use one unless I was going to exercise, then I use two scoops. This is real good. I use water for my shakes so it won't be more calories. If you ever decide to do a shake diet, just know you're going to piss it off if you use water, milk have you on the toilet so it's best to do the water. I love this product! I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain. I even feel it once I'm done but later that day or the next day, the pain is gone! If you buy this product, you'll love it! Great taste too if you know what you're doing.	8	2

But I still am enjoying this coffee. I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh.	0	1

1	B000LKU3WY	ATN552TF5V40Z	best ginger candy	This is definitely the best ginger candy outside of eating crystallized ginger root.

I am buying more for my pregnant friend to get her through her first trimester.	0	0
-1	B003WNZ5ZW	A2DXYS4V750QBF	Not undrinkable, but...	While this doesn't taste terrible, the bergamot flavor that gives Earl Grey it's particular zing is quite weak in this tea. Celestial Seasonings makes one that has a more lively flavor that I would recommend over Twinings.	2	0
-1	B000F0BVYE	A13SV7V95KQBXQ	May work for squirrels, but absolutely not chipmunks!	Maybe Havahart wised up & stops listing chipmunks as one of the targeted rodents, but the 2-lb bottle I got from my local Home Depot still lists chipmunks (text & photo) as a targeted rodent and I was duped into getting this.  I used it according to directions & there was no rain/wind for a good 2 days after application. I haven't seen a squirrel since but my chipmunks are ATTRACTED, not repelled by it. So this product (or its earlier ver. still sold by Home Depot) is useless towards chipmunks. It may work well for squirrels from what I observe. I returned my bottle to H.D. today albeit I used 95% of it already.	2	2

-1	B002ANA68G	A2QDVYO7VCQ3VX	Company sold out. No different from regular grocery dog food.	I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past).

He loves Starbucks coffee directly from Starbucks, as well as Dunkin Donuts (prepared at home).  He said that he liked the taste of the coffee (although it was more vanilla-y than he normally likes).  He said that he liked that the coffee was strong and ""packed a punch"", but was a little too fine a texture than he prefers.  Overall, while he does not really like vanilla-flavored coffee, he did like this coffee enough to buy it again."	0	0

-1	B002D4DY8G	A3GTJ37QK2SPSB	"Just say ""no"" to this cup of joe"	"After opening the fancy box and unsealing the gold bag, I was excited to brew a few cups of succulent, chocolate richness.  Instead, I got a pot of synthetic-tasting sweetness that was completely unbefitting of the Gevalia name.  This tastes like a cup of store-brand coffee seasoned with those artificial flavoring tablets or Coffee-Mate flavored creamer.  What's more, there was none of the characteristic freshness that ""bag"" coffee typically has.  For a much better cup of chocolaty coffee, try Millstone's Chocolate Velvet, which has an immeasurably smoother, more natural chocolate taste (and carries a much smaller price tag).  One part Gevalia Kaffe Dark Chocolate mixed with three parts unflavored coffee makes a more palatable cup, but the saccharine sweetness and totally artificial taste are just way too intense when brewed ""straight."" Truly not a good cup of joe."	2	1

-1	B001EQ5JKK	A2BSLZK1166NMB	Smooth and uncomplicated.	Initially I had wanted to try what the British drink seeing it is one of the mostpopular. I do find it smooth and uncomplicated however I do enjoy my tea with sugar/splenda and dairy thus it makes no difference from my usually everyday brand.

1	B004KVBMN4	A2SCUC8CV6O76C	A lot better than expected.	"I tried a bite out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised by how aromatic and delicious this is! My 9 month old loves it too, but she also likes spicy and herby foods (probably because I eat a lot of garlic). It is VERY potent, so I can see why a lot of babies wouldn't like it, but if you have a little one who seems bored of Gerber's cardboardy ""mixed dinners"" then I strongly recommend. Garlic is a great food to introduce to your babies anyways because it's loaded with nutrients and fights infection, and if you're worried about the smell just mix in some chopped parsley."	0	0

-1	B000VK8AVK	A16UH2O4UVYOJZ	Dissappointing	"To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips."	1	4

This one is just ""ok"", not totally nasty, yet not great either, but it is cheap, so that's a plus (I guess). I usually get the Peet's Tea brand, but it is SO expensive ($10 per 1/4 pound).<br /><br />This tea is a bargain if you can embrace the nastiness. :)"	1	3
1	B002GJ9JWS	A2U28V57CPSP9E	Great taste, less fat!	I was leery about buying this product, but I decided to give it a try anyway. It's great, and a lot less fat for those who would like eat to peanut butter more frequently than its natural fat content allows. It tastes like a natural peanut butter brand, not like a Skippy or Jif. I like to add 1 teaspoon of honey to it sometimes. Be aware that 1 serving of prepared PB2 is not the same amount as a TBSP of peanut butter, it is a little less.	1	0

-1	B004US1ZXO	A4J5V6KMSDDKM	Smells Bad, Tastes Worse	I've been experimenting with different cooking sauces and found this on sale at my local grocer, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's a really think sauce, almost like ketchup, but has a coarser texture.<br />When I heated it up in a pan, it just sat there and didn't spread out much.  I finally spread it around with a spatula and added my chicken.<br />It smelled like cheap vinegar, not like any kind of curry sauce I've ever tried (and I've tried quite a few). It tasted a lot like cheap vinegar, too. I added a little bit of tandoori powder and a little bit of Thai basic cooking sauce I happened to have handy and managed to save the meal.<br />I still have half a bottle of the stuff and I haven't decided what to do with it (Toss it? Mix it with something else?). All I know is it's no good by itself and it has managed to stink up the whole apartment.	0	0

Not only that, but for this recipe the shells are perfect - they hold the flavor MAGNIFICENTLY! It only takes minutes to prepare.

-1	B008FHUGNQ	A1PRR7KT15YQK1	PRICE INCREASE-NO LONGER A GREAT DEAL	I have been ordering this coffee for about a year because it was the best deal around. Using the Amazon Subscribe and Save program, a pack of 50 K Cups previously cost $17.85 delivered. That's .36 cents a cup. The cost went up a few months ago to $23.59 for a box of 50. That's .47 cents a cup. The new Amazon price is what you would expect to pay in any retail store. I see K Cups selling for $11.99 for a box of 24.

1	B004JRKEH4	A34WGXES0FG1B8	Tasty with Zip	As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for a way to add zing to food.  Luckily, I added the chipotle sauce from Taco Bell to my meal, and it was delicious.  You only need a small amount to get a lot of flavor.<br /><br />I cooked 1/2 cup of Morningstar crumbles and 1/2 cup of Rotel tomatoes in a skillet till the liquid was cooked.  Then I removed from skillet, added 2 tblsp. chipotle sauce, added daiya non-dairy cheddar cheese and put in a tortilla wrap.<br /><br />Goes great with a side of refried beans, black beans, or Mexican corn.  Low in calorie, healthy, and filling.  I definitely recommend.  The only thing that would make it better is if the product were vegan.	0	0

1	B005ZBZM52	A18LAQNW27JLPO	Impressed doesn't cover it!	I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. I've been looking for a delicious dark roast organic coffee that wasn't bitter. My first shipment was scheduled to arrive on June 6, but to my surprise, arrived June 4. I opened up the box, and was pleased first off to see that the pods were packed into bags of 8, in order to keep them fresh longer. This was a plus, because no one wants stale coffee that has lost it's 'umph', and I had wondered how I was going to manage to keep all of the pods fresh until I used them up. The exposed filter had concerned me, but with the amount of coffee I drink, they won't have time to go stale opening one of the small bags at a time.<br /><br />My curiosity about the coffee couldn't stand any more, so I cut open one of the bags. The smell was amazing! Before I had even brewed my first cup, I knew this was going to be good. There was no 'burnt' smell to the coffee, just pleasant, rich aroma. Although I had already had my normal 4 cups for the day, I just had to have a cup immediately to see if it tasted as good as it smelled. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was quite impressed.<br /><br />The coffee is rich and bold without the bitterness of many dark roasts. It's very smooth and just begs you to drink more. I'm not an expert, so I won't try to rate the acidity, flavor notes, or anything like that, but I am a life long coffee lover and 4 cup a day drinker, so for me to say that this coffee is impressive means that at least I have some experience with different tasting coffees and it has passed my personal tests. If you prefer a 'weaker' cup of coffee, you can even brew twice from the same pod into a larger travel mug. It's good either way, I just personally prefer strong coffee.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee for it's flavor, it's value, and on top of those, the fact that it's organic and produces less waste than typical K-cups. If you are looking for a smooth, dark roast coffee, by all means give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend a try. You'll be glad you did.	3	0

I found this gum to be impossible to chew because I have ONE crown on a molar.  The entire piece of gum stayed solidly stuck to the crown the whole time I was trying to chew it, forming a gum-coating on that one tooth.  I am sure that I can find someone to take this pack off my hands, but unfortunately, this one piece has been enough for me.  Other than that one issue, the gum seemed good and I think it would have been ok if I didnt have a crown.  :(	4	0

I read the other reviews on it and decided to give it a try.  My mistake; I now have a ""ton"" of tea (2 lbs) that, to my taste, has almost none of the l.s. smokey character.  If you want the distinctive smokey, almost peat-like flavor of l.s., don't bother with this one.  With some sugar, it was slightly reminiscent of l.s. (the only reason for my 2-stars instead of 1), so I guess I haven't totally wasted my money.  Honestly, I'm not even sure someone who only wants to sample the lightest l.s. flavor would feel rewarded with this brand (Coffee Bean Direct).  I won't buy it again, needless to say."	7	0

1	B000JMBE3Q	A39E7IWNHY62JT	Easy Indian food in a few minutes & Not too spicy!	"Yummy, yummy!<br />This curry paste is now my favorite.  It is easy to use, store, and best of all it is delicious!  Pataks Curry is very mild....not super spicy like many others.  My husband likes flavor and a little spice so this is his favorite as well.  I can use the one jar for about 4 meals which is a great deal.<br /><br />I have found that is it so simple to make a ""stir-fry""  with a protein like tofu, chicken or even salmon and then add veggies such as carrots, or potatoes.  There are many combinations and just about any typical veggie taste great in this sauce (love cauliflower).  I think it is best kept simple with 2 or 3 ingredients.<br /><br />This sauce is great for an easy meal with guests, throw the rice in the steamer, make the curry stir-fry, and add another side dish and you are set.  Our friends love it!<br /><br />Pataks also makes other great sauces but this is my favorite to keep on hand at all times."	4	0
-1	B0000DKQ59	AKWP7LOOOF3NB	Good, but not as strong as I wanted	I wanted something similar to the vanilla powder that they have in coffee shops for my morning coffee.<br /><br />This powder does taste and smell like vanilla, but doesn't seem to have a strong flavor. Maybe the coffee shop powder uses artificial flavoring to make it more intense? Or maybe this one is 'watered down' too much with maltodextrin?<br /><br />In any case, it's not bad, but still not quite what I'm looking for.	0	0
-1	B000ER3EFC	A2YPI5IOYF5713	Still shipping BPA containing stock	I just ordered this product hoping that Amazon was carrying/shipping their newly BPA-free stock. I ordered many different types of Earth's Best jarred baby foods from Amazon, and unfortunately, the Sweet Potatoes that I received ( April 5 2012 ) were the old stock that contain BPA in the lids. No idea when they'll start shipping the BPA free sweet potato 12 packs, but I won't be ordering these from Amazon for awhile.<br /><br />Note: I spoke with Earth's Best customer service, and they informed me that the lids that have yellow on the bottom side are the ones that contain BPA. The newer, BPA-free jars, which they started switching to mid last year (2011) have a white bottom cap side. FYI, the BPA containing jars had expiration dates of April 2013, whereas my other non-BPA containing jars had expiration dates of fall of 2013, such as November and October.<br /><br />Hope this helps!	3	0

They sent me something, which is not what I expected. The bags were not vacuum-sealed, the flavor gone, taste like hay. RUBBISH. What are they thinking of there? Selling total crap for top money? I saw the same experience here in a review, the bags were not sealed, no jasmine flavor. So you see Im not alone. WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM!	1	1

A friend told me about Nido (thanks Maggie!) and I have been using it ever since.  I also like that it comes from European cows where they have better laws to protect the animals.  I like the idea of using milk from well treated cows.  Then I tried it in making my pumpkin pie and it was one of the best pies ever.  I have a friend who's grand daughter won't eat much.  Her mom stirs some of this milk powder into everything she can from oatmeal to cocoa.  The girls health is improving.  I love this stuff.	2	0

It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.

1	B004JR7SF0	A2Q7WFMGYCY08Q	1 cat loves it, 1 just likes it.	I was looking for treats I could use for training. Two adult cats were new to our home and were learning what repeatable behaviors to do more of (use the scratching post and other things.) I wanted to completely avoid treats full of carbohydrates or other nasties that my adult cats would get loaded up with.  It was suggested to me to take a look at freeze dried treats as an option and I liked that these didn't look like some of the others that looked like styrofoam peanuts that would crumble into dust if one was dropped on the floor!<br /><br />They are quite small and look exactly like the shrimp that come in the shrimp flavored cup-o-noodles soup. Since the shrimp are very flat and very small, sometimes it looks like it is a challenge for them to see the treat and also to pick the shrimp up to eat them. They get it eventually. Sometimes it takes a little extra effort.<br /><br />My food-motivated cat took to the treats right away. At the smell of them, she gets excited and starts pacing and can't wait to munch on them. She loves them and would eat the whole bag if I would let her!<br /><br />The second cat who is not so much food-motivated did not know what to do with them at first. She actually did not touch these treats for the first two days I used them. Just before I was about to give up, she ended up taking a nibble on one of them and has liked to eat them since. This cat will eat a couple of them with some enthusiasm but then quickly lose interest.<br /><br />I haven't tried other flavors. Overall I really like the product and would recommend it and even buy it again. For the price and the amount of treats that comes in them, I am very pleased. I feel the value is great for such a healthy treat. I am still on the look out for the one protein-based cat treat that will drive BOTH of the cats crazy and keep both of their interest consistently.	0	0
-1	B003D5IV46	AA8JDQ39GVWWQ	The Worst!	"I just finished eating two of these, and I can say that they really are awful. The worst part has to be the coating. It is nothing like the chocolate covered Oreo's that usually come out at Christmas. You can tell from just looking at them that they are cheaply made. I believe that the coating is made from palm oil, as the package states that it is in them. This stuff not only tastes greasy and bad, but it also sits on your stomach the same way. Adults won't enjoy this, unless you have a cast iron stomach that can digest grease. Save your money, maybe this is a good time for us all to eat fruit instead.  (ps: you only get a thin, very thin Oreo. So thin, that I really wasn't even sure it was an Oreo.<br /><br />Update: Last week I was at a discount store and the manager came on the speakers and said they were selling ""fudge covered Oreos for .$50 a pack."" So I hurried to the front, and to my disappointment it was these things. I thought they were having the real fudge covered Oreos like you get around Christmas. I told the manager about my review on Amazon. No one was buying these things as I'm sure they had tried them before. I felt that the manager anticipated them flying off the shelves. They were still there when I checked out!"	0	1

I think this is one of the worst tasting peppered beef jerky i have tried. Way to sweet, but if that is what you are looking for, then go for it.<br />Ok, I hated that beef jerky. It was gross.

They are great for people who get the shakes from coffee also. I prefer really brewed pots of coffee but these are a great substitute when I only have time for a cup and really need to get back to sleep in a couple of hours. Great taste, expensive like all K cups but not bad if you only drink a couple of cups. Well worth keeping on hand.	0	0
1	B0049ZCFBE	A1OW7I4LC4YCKO	Excellent crunchy chocolate snack	This is an excellent snack for me.  It has the things I crave, all in a nice healthy package - chocolate, crunch, a touch of saltiness.  They have a wonderful chocolate taste without the bad calories.  Much healthier than the alternatives of chocolates and cookies and chips (or choc-chip cookies)!<br /><br />The packaging is particularly good - the small opening ensures that I take a small serving every time.  I don't have to eat very many before I am satisfied.  The side of the package has a vertical slit lets you see how full the container is, and has measured lines that you can use to limit your serving size.<br /><br />I really don't have anything bad to say about these.  Buy them if you crave chocolate and/or crunchiness!	2	0

Bob's Red Mill sells a few varieties of oatmeal, and the one listed (quick-cooking) is not the one pictured, described, or sold (instant). Indeed, Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Rolled Oats is not the same as Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats. This listing sells the Instant Rolled Oats, yet is titled as Quick Cooking. Some people feel that the Quick Cooking Oats is tastier than Instant, and when they place an order for the former, they don't want to receive the latter. I am deliberately giving this listing a low rating to draw your attention, in case this makes a big difference for you.<br /><br />The product itself is very good, of course, and I would gladly give Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats five stars if only it were the item listed. I urge Nutricity to make corrections to its listing as soon as possible.	2	1
1	B0018CE7BC	AWK53IL1AYBZ6	Very good food.	I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.	2	0

1	B0014EW5MW	AOINAOO0NQRGN	Converting a healthy choice into an unhealthy feast	Being a senior citizen and all, I know how to stretch a buck here and there. If I don't, I go hungry, or at the very least have to see if Meals on Wheels has a few TV dinners to spare. When Campbell's chunky soups hit around a buck fifty or so, I start stocking the pantry.<br /><br />This soup is supposed to be healthy. I don't actually pay much attention to that. It tastes pretty good, it's filling, and I can even identify chunks of chicken amidst all the noodles. This makes it a good base for some further enhancements--more salt, some Parmesan cheese, Louisiana hot sauce, baco-bits, you name it. These chunky soups are an excellent opportunity for some culinary experimentation.<br /><br />If you're really determined to be healthy, then the basic soup is certainly as good as anything else out there. But at $1.50 a can or so, we might as well cut loose and party a little. A cheap thrill here and there is certainly better than daytime TV.	1	1

However, she was looking at her long, long, hair in the sun today and she thought ""Wow, my hair could be in a hair color advertisement and I would want to get that color."" So, I know color isn't relevant to this review, but the point was that she was looking at 4 or 5 year old hair and it was shiny, and smooth and beautiful even though she was out flying a kite in the wind with my kids. I asked her if she thinks this shampoo has made her hair stronger. She thinks that is kind of a subjective thing: difficult to measure.

With that being said, I'm going to be bold and assert that the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are going to be too sweet for anyone over the age of 11.  Unless you're drinking really black coffee with them.  The kind of black coffee that is so dark and strong, you wouldn't be able to see ANY light through it if it were in a clear cup. Besides that, if you're looking at these cookies here on Amazon with intent to order a bunch, you should note that they don't travel well.  My package arrived looking like most of the cookies went through a rock tumbler (on the bright side, I guess they're ready to be made into a cookie-crumb crust?).  They ARE chewy.  Gooey?  I wouldn't go that far.  Maybe on a really hot day, or if you put some on a plate and microwaved a few seconds.  Finally, they have sort of a Play-Doh aftertaste if Play-Doh were made with lots and lots of sugar.  Chips Ahoy has a good thing going with their original cookies.  I think these are an abomination and should be skipped right over with no regrets.	0	2
1	B005ZBZLT4	AY08FJR13HWNV	Great Coffee	"I generally like the stronger coffees.  A lot of the k-cups have been very weak and flavorless.  I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what ""smell"" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.  I singed up for the subscribe and save to get it delivered regularly so I dont run out.  I just hope others find it as great tasting as I do so amazon keeps carrying it!"	2	0

I was upset that I forgot to buy it before we left the city and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to find it online.  This coffee is very good, slight(and perfect) taste of chicory, rich taste without the burnt taste sometimes associated with a full-bodied blend.

When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it.	2	1
1	B001AJ1ULS	A2TCHP0BF9OLVL	Great product. AMAZING PRICE!	I have been giving this to my dog every day for about 2 years because he has a patella problem. His limping has completely stopped as a result, not to mention he cries for it! Definitely his favorite treat by far. I was spending more than 1/3 the price at the local pet store for just one pack! I should have checked Amazon sooner! This is an amazing price. I will be buying this here exclusively from now on.	0	0
-1	B001P3NU3K	AYQO1JN4J0K10	Dog Teeth Cleaning Product	I originally got a package of these from my Holistic Vets office as a Thank you Gift.  So I decided to order some for my Large Breed Dog and more for my Small Breed.  Then when they arrived I decided to Read the Package and To My Surprise I noticed they were MADE in MEXICO (distributed from the Verbec plant in Texas).<br /><br />I emailed My Vet right away and asked him if he was aware of this because he really supports this item and his answer was NO !  He was Not aware that the Texas Facility had CHANGED their Manufacturing Plant to MEXICO !  So he kindly said I could return the products.  And said he'd call the Company in Texas and ask them what was up, why they changed.<br />Unfortunately I still have not gotten an answer from my Vet and emailed him back (he is a VERY Busy Vet Being Nominated #1 Vet in the Chicago Land Area recently.)  So he said he'd delegate it to his Office Manager.<br /><br />SO BEWARE !  What you once thought to be Made in AMERICA may not be anylonger !  I will discontinue using these until my Vet has an answer for me to continue to use or not.  I bet he'll say Not.<br /><br />I say it's an OK product because my Dogs do like it.  But It should be rated a ZERO because it is NOT made in America and the company did NOT make the Vets aware that they were changing their Manufacturing Plant to Mexico	0	4

1	B000VKA92I	A3BOEBS1GBIFBE	Wonder Drug!	I began giving this to my 10 year old lab two weeks ago after noticing the sudden onset of weakness in his back legs. Along with this came a drop in his energy which I attributed to old age setting in.<br />After two weeks of giving him this stuff twice daily I've noticed:<br /><br />1. Considerable strengthening of his back legs<br />2. Significantlly increased energy<br />3. His coat is better than it's been in years<br /><br />And there's been an unexpected benefit: his persistent eye infection has completely gone away. No more runny nose. No more eye discharge. No more droppy eyes. All had been treated by my vet with antibotics on two separate occasions only to have the symptoms return withing weeks.<br /><br />I don't know which ingredient is responsible for the improvement but it's well worth the $20 I paid for this. This is a terrific product!	0	0
-1	B000GW46EI	A1Q51RFBBLGR2U	Not Sure the Point-Bad Packaging	"CAREFUL!!  My nine year old stepson is around people that dip REAL tobacco in similar packaging.  Therefore, he idolizes this as a way to mock the older guys and their bad habit.  When he came for a visit he wanted some so we bought it.  Next thing we know, he was asking for a snack.  When we inquired about the jerky, he said it was not to eat but to ""put in your mouth and suck the juice"".  He even packed it like grown men do their tobacco chew.  Granted, a child will absorb what he sees around him but I feel the packaging makes it look too much like a child's version of adult chew; reminds me of the candy cigarettes. So, this product in my opinion is either for a child as a stepping stone to chewing tobacco or an adult's step down from it...otherwise, what's the point?"	1	7
-1	B0029XDZDK	AZK3YI6CJI23R	Coffee good but not great--- k-cup quality awful	"Opinions on coffee, like those on most food or drink are subjective. On coffee quality only, I would give this product 4 stars... like I said, ""good, but not great"".<br /><br />On the other hand, the quality of the K-Cups is a very objective item. I purchased my first (and last) box of the ""Coffee People"" cups after Amazon discontinued the ""Subscribe and Save"" on the Timothy's Parisian Nights K-Cups, in April of 2011.<br /><br />I provided Amazon with direct feedback that this product is substandard, and also noticed that many of the poor reviews of this product were from customers complaining of leaky or otherwise badly constructed k-cups. Some of these reviews were from over 1 year ago. (Shame on me for not catching this  prior to choosing this product.)....<br /><br />My advice, don't buy this brand... the bad cups will end up costing you more than what it would cost to buy KCups at your local grocer."	0	0
1	B003GSK4CW	A4W8OI7G8OTHE	Works great	Works perfectly, I bought the 6 pack of Torani Syrups so I wish they would sell this in a 6 pack but otherwise great.  Makes adding variety to my morning coffee a breeze.	2	1
-1	B000LNC3YM	A3SIS5X9C9H0Y8	"""Soursop Leaves Tea"" or ""Soursop Leaves""???"	"Description of the product says: ""Soursop Leaves Tea"". Actually, I have received a small bag (about 1/2 once) of Soursop Leaves not the TEA. Besides that, the quality of the leaves is marginal - they were not dried properly and look and smell similar to brownish autumn leaves in the late autumn forest. And to make it all just a bit better: the bag contains in addition to the bad dried leaves - small particles of grass and herbs dust. Now you got the picture - if it describes the product you are willing to brew a tea from - go ahead and order, otherwise STAY AWAY!"	23	8
-1	B002M5GZLE	A29TKMI8CK3H2Y	chocolate is like a rock!	The chocolate covering is so hard. I order this as well as the dark chocolate covered mango.

1	B001EQ4SHK	A3UUUG76OAVJ0V	Wonderful	I thought I'd up the chocolate factor in my chocolate cake and bought a bunch of Ghirardelli cocoa off this site.  It was terrible.

1	B000KV61FC	A3I6HOCJN9KNZV	Cool toy, too bad my dog is too stupid	Oh I mean, I love my dog.  A lot.  But he is FAR too dumb to figure this out.  He instead just whacks me in the knee with it until I pull the rope out and bring some treats out.<br /><br />Hmm...maybe he's not the dumb one.<br /><br />It's definitely challenging.  Frustrates my dog more than entertains him and is pretty formidable when connecting with sensitive kneecap tissue.	2	0
1	B000G1CG50	A3TDMH1Z8CUBAF	Great product...	My dogs LOVE the Yummy Chummies and we've been giving them to all three since they were puppies (our oldest is now 5). We normally buy them at COSTCO but they were out for two months, so I ordered them at Amazon. Quite a mark up guys! I pay $9.39 for a 2.5 lb bag at Costco and $25.00 at Amazon!! Today, Costco carried them again, so I stocked up. They are excellent treats and my dogs are worth it, but come on guys, THAT much of a markup?? Yikes!	9	0

-1	B0049PRPCI	A1KQ10GZTGO2R	Misleading	The Coffee Shop pod in this pack is replaced with the Coffee House pod by Green Mountain, even though the Coffee Shop pods are described and pictured.

-1	B005K4Q68Q	A24MI2GG040LY7	Still Looking	When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.	0	0
1	B0000DIRZS	A33K3PCPDX2SL	Superior old-fashioned fruit slices	I bought 3 flavors: cherry, lemon and lime. All are terrific. The texture and density is wonderful...they give just the right amount to the tooth, neither too soft nor too hard. And the flavors are excellent. They come in perfect sizes, too...I think they're 1 pound packages double wrapped in clear celophane with a gold twist tie so perfectly adequate for gifts, too. I'll be a customer as long as The Candy Depot makes these confections. And, NO FAT!	0	0
-1	B000LKUTLE	A348IT6M7H8A67	Excellent Quinoa, Way Over Priced.	I love Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa.  It is well picked over for twigs, hulls and debris and has been very well rinsed.  It is ready to cook right out of the bag as it is so you can toast it in the pan before adding the cooking liquid.  That makes quinoa taste so much better.<br /><br />It is way too over priced though.  Even the way over priced Bob's Red Mill brand is quite a bit cheaper.  Quinoa of this quality should not cost more than $3.99/lb.  If you live near a Trader Joe's or a good bulk food store get your quinoa there.  Currently, here on Amazon, Arrowhead Mills comes in at about that price if you sign up for Subscribe & Save but I've heard that it is not as well rinsed which would be a problem quality wise.  Eden quinoa costs over $4/lb here but is still cheaper than Bob's Red Mill or Ancient Harvest.<br /><br />So quality wise I'd give this 5 stars but because of the poor price/value I give it 1 star, hence the 3 star review.	4	0
-1	B000E48P54	A3UKW5VUGXVG30	The Sweet Stuff	In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better.	16	0
-1	B003V30NOQ	A38GMW8CODKV1Z	Tastes Good- BUT Tastes A Bit Maple Syrupy and Has Aftertaste	Overall this does taste good..But, has a distinct maple syrup taste- and, I don't really like maple syrup:  Much less when that taste is present in a BBQ Snack Mix!  I was thinking that some of you may not either so you should be aware.<br />  Also an aftertaste seems to be there afterwards (so I took off 2stars for this).<br /><br />  However, the maple taste isn't totally overwhelming.  And, although this snack mix does taste mapley the BBQ taste is still flavorfully evident and it does still taste good:  So, since I tend to dislike maple that says a lot!<br /><br />  Also, this 1.5 ounce bag has less than 180cals and a lot of protein: 15grams Protein per bag, so it's recommended!	1	0
-1	B007M832YY	A28WXDXJA1P0MC	"These definitely taste like ""diet"" chips"	After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass.	1	0
-1	B0018Q2N3C	A1XZ2R37RYKZXI	Reacted very badly to this pasta	My wife and I ate the recommended serving (2 oz dried). It was delicious, and we felt full afterwards. Later that night, neither of us slept well because we were so hungry. I don't know if this is related, but we both had heart palpitations that night.<br /><br />We both woke up feeling starved. I usually don't even feel hungry in the morning! My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us. We're throwing out all the boxes that I bought based on the 5 star ratings here. If you want to try it, start with a single box and see how it makes you feel.	7	4
-1	B005BSPOHU	A2NG14OG3GWLU4	Useless Product, Expired date	I purchased this product thinking that it would be a good alternative to Senseo pods that are hard to find at a good price. They DO NOT fit a Senseo machine. I was not concerned since I have a nice Krups expresso machine and the pods fit perfectly into the coffee receptical. Expecting a nice Starbucks shot, all that came out was slightly colored water. The pods were expired for nearly 8 months, so there was no way I would keep them. I returned the product, but had to pay $12.00 to ship it back, after paying for shipping to get it to me! I have bought many things from Amazon, but this is by far the worst. Do not buy this terrible product.	7	2
1	B001CEJ86K	A3K7QRGMDCPI5N	Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon; pack of 4 cans	Amazon Verified<br /><br />I think this must be the best salmon available with the exception of fresh.  I would not hesitate to give it five stars, but I have it delivered automatically every month and, in my last delivery, one of the cans was so dented on the side that the top of the can bulged.  I had to discard it because I was afraid to eat food from a bulging can.  This is the first time this has happened and I'm hoping it's the last because I would feel hate to have to stop getting it.	2	1

-1	B004JGQ15E	A1BTG38XSGYLW3	Tasty, not entirely unhealthy, VERY sweet	"Not that I would expect something called ""Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn"" not to be sweet, but seriously, the first ingredient is brown sugar -- that's right, there is more brown sugar than popcorn in this!  The next three ingredients are popcorn, sugar, and corn syrup, so three out of the top four ingredients are sugars.  Also, 2.5 out of the 3 grams of fat in each serving are highly saturated palm oil (""and/or palm kernel oil,"" which is certainly no better).<br /><br />On the plus side, Nabisco appears to have made an effort to use only ""real"" foods in this snack:  skim milk, cocoa, salt, soybean oil, soy lecithin, and vanilla extract round out the list of ingredients.<br /><br />Snackwell's snacks are positioned as ""a sensible snack"" aimed at ""weight conscious women"" (from their own ad copy).  If you really want the fudge drizzle, and you can really eat just one pack, the Snackwell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn will definitely hit your sweet tooth and wouldn't be a horrible choice healthwise.  However, each pack provides just over an ounce of caramel corn, a handful, for 130 calories, 2.5 grams of saturated fat, and 190 mg of sodium (8% of the recommended daily value).<br /><br />Compare this to, say, Cracker Jack -- you can eat the whole box, peanuts and all, for 150 calories, 2.5 grams of fat (none of which is saturated fat), and only 90 mg of sodium.  Or, have a full cup of Orville Redenbacher's microwave caramel corn for 80 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, and a mere 20 mg of sodium, less than 1% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />In my book, that doesn't make Snackwell's the most sensible snack."	1	1
1	B004ASBLJ2	A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV	Great Low-Fat Snack	I love chips but don't love all the fat and calories they have.  These are a great alternative.  One serving (one ounce) has 120 calories and 3.5 grams of fat.  These taste great and have a nice satisfying crunch just like chips do but are much better for me.  My only complaint is that the butter flavor sometimes leaves a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  I've also tried the sea salt flavor and the white cheddar flavor.  Neither of those leave an aftertaste.  My favorite is the white cheddar flavor.	2	0
1	B0000DK4ZR	A1UVM0C4ITY0MU	Birthday surprise	Grandson and son-in-law were thrilled with their favorite ice cream topping from the ice cream store near their home. It simply made the birthday party a big success. They couldn't wait to pack the bag to take home.	0	0
-1	B001LGGH54	A2I3XS9TO93Q0F	"Great taste... but what are you ""really"" looking for?"	I love the taste of this soda alternative; however I'm left with a bit of confusion.  I would love to have a healthier alternative to soda, one that provides the vitamins and nutrition of fruit juice, but not at the cost of more calories.  And therein lies the problem, I don't want to have to pay for the nutrients by accepting more calories.  And The Switch has even more calories than regular soda.<br /><br />Perhaps it all depends on what your definition of healthy is, or how well your metabolism is tuned.  If you value a natural, vitamin-robust drink that does not have those nasty artificial ingredients - AND you can burn off the 140 calories - then great, this is a nice choice.  For me, calorie count is the first thing I look at, and the only way to keep that down is to use those otherwise nasty artificial ingredients or just squeeze a fresh lemon wedge into a glass of water.	0	1
-1	B003D4MYLS	ABZIENFOI33TI	Terrible tasting tea; also contains citric acid	Unfortunately, I found this tea to have a simply awful taste.<br />I did not mind the box haphazardly-crammed full of 100 tea envelopes, but the tea itself has a nasty bitter taste--I have used lots of different kinds of ginger teas, so I believe I know how ginger tea should taste.<br />I was surprised to find that one of the ingredients is citric acid, though I don't understand why they would include that ingredient in an herbal tea.	0	1
-1	B001H0FI36	A1RL1OTV8IJMVD	Make your own. It tastes better!	Of all the Dolcue Gusto flavors, this is the one I like the least. It's not that there's anything wrong with hot chocolate, it's just that you can do a lot better than this attempt. If you like hot cocoa from normal powdered mixes, then this is a slight step up. But it's not creamy enough! I'd recommend just making your own cocoa at home from scratch. You'll be more pleased with the results. This one's not worth 150 calories.<br /><br />2/5	2	2
-1	B0029NXAK8	APMT63OXQ4AYM	can't stomach this one	I bought these by mistake at the grocery store--I usually buy the Mini Dentastix, which my two Bostons love with no problem.  I gave each of them one Jumbone about 6:00 pm, and this morning they both vomited it up.  They didn't woof them down whole, they were chewed, but came out this morning in solid chunks.  I trashed the rest of the treats.  Maybe it's just my dogs that couldn't digest the Jumbones--they never had sensitive stomachs before, but thought I'd pass this along.	0	0

-1	B002V0240Q	ADWL6PX6QM3ZJ	Bad taste, sugar, dry, expensive.	These were expensive, even with a coupon, and I still hated them so much I threw them out.<br /><br />Here's why:<br />1) They taste a lot like raisins.  I don't like raisins, but raisins taste better and are juicier than these. Other than the raisin-taste factor, there was something else off about the flavor, which the other reviewer mentioned.<br />2) They are flavored with sugar.  That would be fine if the sugar made them taste good, but it doesn't.<br />3) Dry.  Most of the berries were flat, dried up little pellets; only a couple per pack had any puffiness left.<br />3) Expensive.  If you like raisins, they are a far better value than these.	0	0
1	B000G1CG50	ALVR5YHX8K57E	Love'em	I originally bought these on a trip to Alaska....small bag. My dog loved them. Their magic, however, is the fact that with all that salmon oil, Yummy Chummies cured an excessive shedding problem. I was brushing daily, taking him for expensive chemical shedding treatments and had even resorted to vacuuming the dog. Nothing helped. The amount of shedding was MAJOR! (I had a Golden for 10 years... I am not a shedding wimp here either). Within 2 days the improvement started and has been wonderful. We are down to normal dog hair in the house and much more snuggle time.	0	0

I thought the bones would be larger; I guess the picture made them seem bigger, but the dimensions are clearly listed so shame on me. I opened the first bone and gave it to my 17 month pitbull boxer mix puppy who loves to chew. He went to town on it almost immediately so I guess it tasted good and that's why I gave it three stars. However, it lasted only about 30 minutes before the bone was completely gone. Given a ""do-over,"" I would pay the same amount for one larger, longer lasting bone. These bones would probably be best for a smaller, not powerful chewer."	2	0
1	B000LKXJEI	A3DYK1CBQ1LY2D	Yummy - even for non-vegetarians!	I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat-like.<br />I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!	0	0
-1	B000FL08B0	A1XKK0RD4PN68G	Did something change?	I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years.  When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.<br />Each bottle had about a half inch of foam on top and had a very strong plastic or soapy taste.  It's hard to describe but it was so bad I was unable to use it.  I contacted Amazon and they were great, sent out a new order right away but when I received the shipment it was as bad as the first.  When I contacted Amazon again they refunded my purchase price and actually made this product unavailable while they checked in to it.  I see it is available again but I never found out what the issue was.<br />I figured it must have been a bad batch so I reordered and did get a new shipment last week, this time of the 2 44 oz bottles.  It was just as bad.  I contacted customer service and they were great and promptly refunded my money.<br />I ended up ordering another very popular, but more expensive, brand.  This 'other' brand is much better.  No problems at all.	2	0

Would not trade them for the world. BUT, there is one thing I do not like. I do not like cleaning out the kitty litter box. UNTIL I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT.<br />I have to admit that I do not use it ""straight"" but am currently mixing it half and half with Swheat. But I am working to the end of using only the pearls. The kids are currently getting used to the feel.<br />BUT ALREADY there is NO ODOR. (Well there is just after they poop, but no one can change that.)<br />But as soon as the waste is buried, the smell evaporates and is gone. I have never seen anything like it.<br />The two big guys share a box and the two small ones have their own. I just cleaned them out. (Trash goes out today.) The big box, which I normally hate to do, was odorless. I scooped out the poop. I scooped out the clumps of urine, including all the small break away clumps and was done. No more rumaging around getting out the odds and ends that had gotten wet and needed to be gotten rid of to get rid of odor. Done in 5 minutes flat.<br />On to the little box. Took the disposable plastic spoon and got out the clumps of poop. Got out the few urine clumps and was done. Two minutes flat.<br />Got the hand held battery driven sweeper and got the dust that hit the floor and was done. It took me  10 minutes to do a job that used to take 30 minutes.<br />And the best part was that it was just a job. It was not a gross out production. I washed my hands with disinfectant soap and came to write the review.<br />Best Kitty Litter Stuff I have ever used. I put it on for monthly delivery and am pleased with the whole deal, cost and all. It arrives at my front door once a month with no extra shopping and cleans up like a breeze. No smell. I certianly recommend it to all kitter people.<br /><br />After using this for almost 6 weeks, I have to amend my first review of this product. Yes, it is amazing and keeps the smell down, but it was not as great as I thought. Initially, I had used it for my two kittens. Their poops are small and they urinate and leave small little domes and both were well covered. Then, I began using this Pure Product (not mixed with any other product with all four of my cats, two of whom are regular cats, one is 16 pounds and one is 11. One is female and one is male. Now males are nice things, but when it comes to male cats, urinating IS a BIG deal. My cat seems to save it up for a one or two times a day process, so when he goes, it is a flood. And Male urine is more pungent than female cat urine. There is too much of it to make the usual nice compact valcano shaped product that the kittens leave. He simly wets down one whole end of the box and it smells to bad to mix with the other and is also too saturated to do so, so one twentieth of the entire box has to be thrown out after Mr. T. uses the box. That automatically means the box cannot be used by him more than 20 times. Then, in comes the female. She does leave a compact volcano shaped urine package, but the poop is huge and has to go. If nobody bothered to cover anything, I could scoop out the poop and lift out the urine and be done. Worked with the kittens. But no, with the addition of two humongo cats, the box is throughly stired and within 4 or 5 days, at the MOST, the whole 7 pounds is used up and gone. I cannot afford 7 pounds of the litter 6 or 7 times a month.<br /><br />Also, with the addition of the two big cats, litter bits were everywhere and walking on that litter is like walking on sand in your house. It tears up the tile and gets in the carpet. Ugh. I spent a lot of time cleaning the laundry room where the boxes are when I used this litter.<br /><br />So overall, I have moved this from a 5 star to a 3 star item. I can't afford it, with bigs cats added, it does smell, and I cannot afford enough to cover 4 cats for the month. So, I have moved it down to three stars. Sorry about that, but REALITY HIT ME!"	2	0

-1	B005HG9ESG	A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE	Funky tasting water	"After a hard and intense set of interval training, a refreshing and replenishing drink is often key to recovery.  The concept of this water seemed sound unlike the sugary drinks that are typical advertised with artificial neon colors and poured over coaches at the end of a winning game.<br /><br />Personally, I'm a big fan of coconut water after hard training, so I have a bit of bias.  The most notable problem I had with this drink is it didn't taste like water should.  The water tasted ""metallic"" which sort of makes sense at a 9.5 pH.  I could barely drink it down as it didn't taste right to me, but I did.  I noticed no benefit after drinking it and felt I had more cramps and shakes than after drinking other replenishing beverages.<br /><br />I see no benefit to this product and it simply doesn't taste right to me."	0	2
-1	B00141OU50	A2YK2OKGDJOKF2	MADE IN CHINA	I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp	17	2

I decided to start giving these to her as a 'bedtime' treat (as an incentive to get her to enjoy going to the crate at night).  I've been using them for about a year now, and at the last vet checkup the doctor said she was surprised at how great her teeth look ... and asked me if I brush them.  Nope!  Just one of these every night.  And it's hilarious because no matter where we are in the house, all I have to say is ""time for bed"" and she sprints and literally RUNS to her crate and gets into it long before I can get there with the 'bone', and when I do finally catch up with her at the crate, she is sitting there smiling patiently, and drooling.  Literally!  It's so funny, everyone in the family laughs about how much she loves her 'bedtime bone'.  And I echo what other reviewers have said ... the Amazon price is a little high.  You can get them at Costco for quite a bit less, but I'm not a member and it's also a 30-minute drive for me.  So I order from Amazon out of convenience."	0	0

I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store.

1	B0018CJXHU	AAU3TOHIK4552	Superb, top of the line dry dog food	I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.	1	0

-1	B001EO5QZK	A1BOXR5OPYYWWJ	Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.	I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.	0	1
-1	B003WLC4VC	A1HZTAWGVYW0YU	Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.	"My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). ""10 bars"" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is ""5 two count packages"". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the ""Pack of 2"" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn."	1	0

I'm able to make fresh organic baby food quickly and easily.  I've only done fruits so far, however, I have not tried meats or multi ingredient recipes.  My only complaints would be that it can be hard to pull out the drive shaft when you go to clean it and if I don't do Steam + blend I have to hold down the blend for the whole time.  It should have a timed setting for the blend too.  With that said, I have still recommended to others.	1	0

1	B0037YPVBE	A3US65TAXI4DFD	I have one every morning mixed with almond milk	"Regular milk, even lactose free milk is hard on my stomach. I love the taste of the vanilla CIB and have found it mixes great with Almond milk (found in the dairy section next to the real milk). Almond milk also has more calcium and more protein than regular milk. I've tried mixing it with coconut milk but could still taste the coconut.<br /><br />I have vanilla CIB every morning for my breakfast, then eat a light lunch around 11, and a regular dinner at 5. There have been times when I wake during the night and find my stomach growling. I don't feel like eating but it's hard to go back to sleep with a hungry tummy. I just get up and mix one of these drinks and go back to sleep.<br /><br />To mix, I pour my tall glass about 3/4 full with almond milk. Dump in a CIB packet and stir with a spoon. Insert straw and drink. It feels odd to me to drink it by sipping on the side of the glass. The mix is a little on the thicker side and I prefer a straw EVERY time.<br /><br />My kids enjoy the chocolate CIB and they like their milk warmed first. They actually call it ""hot chocolate"". They too, have some every morning and then a light breakfast of toast or cereal."	1	1

-1	B001EQ5ERI	AV7PMKYSN8V0O	Bitter!	I had high hopes for this coffee based on the reviews but was let down.  I picked up a can of this to have on hand incase I ran out of fresh beans for my grinder and I'm glad that I didn't get the 4 pack!  Perhaps I got a bad batch since the reviews here are mostly positive but I found this to be incredibly bitter when making espresso in my Rancilio Silvia.  I varied my dose, tamp, extraction time and temperature but nothing got rid of the horrendous, bitter/sour taste.  After several unsuccessful attempts I pulled a shot using my fresh ground beans to see if I was doing something wrong and had a great shot right off the bat.  Go figure.  On the positive side the grind is fine and even enough for an unpressurized portafilter.  This stuff may be fine for other brewing methods, I didn't try them, but I can't recommend it for espresso unless you really like bitter shots.  Perhaps I just like a darker roast, in the end I tossed it as I was unable to brew a drinkable shot.	0	0

-1	B008FHUKE6	A3RTK2OIDCN1E2	Good Product Bad Packeting	I was happy to get my coffee. Me without coffee is like a baby without her sippy cup! I tore the box open and my heart sank. The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth! See, 10 percent is a lot. Bottom line, I'm not ordering K-cups on-line anymore. I guess I'll just get of my butt and head down to the store. It will be worth the extra expense.<br /><br />Arthur M.

-1	B002AQL00G	A6C94GK7BLD7R	Helpful hint	These cookies are great right out of the oven but left to sit for more than a day or 2 they tend to get this sandy, crumbly texture.  The Betty Crocker brownies taste great and keep much better.  Might I also suggest that if you don't know how some of the gluten free products taste to begin with and to save money and probably waste, see if you can find it at your local store.  If you like it enough then buy it in the bulk that Amazon sells.  I have read a few reviews of customers who have purchased in bulk, don't like the item(s) and have been left with a product they don't want to use at all.  Buy one package (if possible and if it is available in your area) and then decide to buy more.  I hope that helps!  And donate the rest of the unwanted product to the food pantry etc.  Thanks!	1	0

-1	B000VK2XA4	A19F03HHSQIAS9	My dog doesn't care for it.	Well, it's kind of hard to review dog food. My dog doesn't seem to like this flavor much. He seems to prefer the lamb and rice version much better. This is a very high quality product, it seems, compared to other dog foods. It is not watery and doesn't stink to high heaven. We're vegetarians, so low quality meat makes me nauseated, but this product is okay in that regard. It's just not my dog's favorite. We only buy the lamb Pet Guard now.	0	0
1	B0030VBQOK	A3F3ND7MLDXKKF	Best way to keep my toddler eating his veggies!	My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.  We found these pouches when buying food for a trip and he was hooked.  I like that the veggies are organic, the pouches produce little garbage, that he can feed himself, but most importantly, that it is keeping the taste of veggies in his diet while we slowly work on chewing veggies.	0	0
-1	B0052BRXFM	A1TSGNNULJW4TI	Wish I had not ordered them, can't return them...	"I have purchased Newman's Own organic cookies before from my local grocery store and loved them. I have to say that it's my fault that I ordered these (the Wheat Free Dairy Free ones) as I was in a hurry and didn't read carefully. I also hate to admit this but I ""assumed"" (yes, we all know that that means, and yes I do feel like one...) that Amazon would stand by the products that they sell and allow returns. No such luck. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Trader Joe's who will take back a product if the customer does not like it.<br /><br />Needless to say these don't taste very well. My teenage kids agree and won't eat them either so now I am left with five unopened packages of cookies that are of no use and I can't return them. (sigh) The bottom line is that I need to read much more carefully and I don't think that I will purchase any more food items from Amazon."	0	1

1	B002KGEO8G	A19PWJYR79ZY1O	Difficult to find, but worth the search	"You may think it is as hot as wasabi paste, but Kameda does a good job of really creating a spicy snack without making it too hot or too bland.<br /><br />The distributor to the Asian stores in our area does not stock this item. Usually when the spouse goes to Japan is the only time we can get this variety. I actually prefer it over the traditional Kaki no tane. FYI: 'kaki"" is the Japanese word for persimmon seed."	0	1

-1	B002T0IHJ0	AIWOLCUA8T2KC	Energy drink taste, little of the effect.	"The taste is spot on but after drinking it I felt little to no effect, but I guess that's what you'll get from a ""healthy"" energy drink with barely any caffeine."	2	2
-1	B008JKSJJ2	A2MFQUJ4I0XVM	looks better than it tastes	i had the other ones from starbucks, but wanted to try something different especially with the combination of macadamia and mango, but this didn't seem to mesh well. probably wont buy these again.	0	0
-1	B000ILK9PM	A2AVYSXICESSTK	BEWARE! Contains MSG.	"The bottle says ""No MSG"" but this is actually false advertising.<br />1. In the US, companies are only required to list MSG on the ingredient label as MSG if it is a pure form of free glutamate.<br />2. It is true that this product does not contain pure MSG.<br />3. Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG.<br />4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else. If Kernel Seasons really did not include MSG, there would be no point in adding these other additives (and it would be much cheaper not to add them).<br /><br />Some people choose to eat foods with MSG, and that's ok.  White Cheddar used to be my favorite Kernel Season's flavor before I learned how to read ingredient labels carefully.  If MSG doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy this if you want.  My husband is severely allergic to MSG, though, and when we were first learning to avoid MSG, labels like this caused him to be very sick.  Why not just remove ""No MSG"" from the package instead of misleading people?  This is really an unethical practice.<br /><br />I felt very disappointed and mislead when I discovered this.  Don't just take my word for it; go learn about the ingredients on the list."	3	2
-1	B000SAPVAQ	A3I4PCBRENJNG2	Davidson's Tea Spiced Pear, 100-Count Tea Bags	ok, but not what I expected.<br />Lots of loose tea from bags in the box, would NOT have made a good gift!<br /><br />Will probably mix it with other tea for iced tea this summer.<br />No, I would not buy again.	1	2
-1	B000JLM2OM	A2OJWFOMBSG0VF	Messy and discolors	This product is messy, smelly and discolors anything it touches.  I should have bought the natural cow ears.  If you feed this to your dogs, make sure its outside.	1	0
-1	B003CWAWS8	A2E0UEXK1WMSHR	Bring back the original React gum!	I was a huge fan of the original React gum, but the React2 gum is dreadful. It smells like Vicks vap-o-rub and tastes like generic sugary-minty lose-its-flavor gum. Avoid it.	1	0
-1	B001E5DRWI	A9C7QEWQ94B7F	Too Bitter, No sesame flavor at all...	I was in a hurry when purchasing the item and did not check my local Asian Market. I trusted Amazon since I rarely had any bad experience with Products sold by Amazon. But I have to day I am extremely disappoited this time.<br /><br />As pointed out by a previous reviewer, the seeds are quite small. They are not all black in terms of the color. I'd rather say something else (regular white sesame seeds?) are mixed in. Even after roasting, the aroma is not nearly as good as those unroasted decent black sesame seeds I had back when I was in China. Most importantly, the flavor! Those seeds are bitter and I dare say, you must put tons of sugar to barely cover the bittness. Unhealthy on one hand, and bad-tasting on the other hand.<br /><br />I went to my local Asian market yesterday and I found the sesame seeds there, black and white, are of much better qualify and a lot cheaper.<br /><br />Bottem line: Would not recommend it to anyone else. Do not waste your money. As much as I like Amazon, you just fail on this one.	2	0
1	B0007A0AQW	A1RKF30YDW8MFG	sit, down and stay	My puppy loves these treats and they are highly motivating when used during training.  They haven't affected her digestion system like cheese or hot dog bites did.  They are small and a few a day make her very happy!	0	0
-1	B0083T6HC0	A2333842WTHK5V	a little disappointed	We ordered this package of keurig coffees and found it contained many teas and chocolates in the assortment. My husband preferred getting more coffees in the assortment and won't order again, Also, one of the containers came torn open (hazelnut cappuccino)--these are too expensive to come ripped open.<br />Disappointed in Maryland.	0	1
-1	B000XIZLUS	A2HN8MZJU7QE58	UCKA!  BELLY FLOPS IS RIGHT!	"I have a sweet tooth for jelly beans every now and then.  And since Jelly Belly jelly beans are among my favorite brands and the price was right, I jumped at the chance to purchase Jelly Belly Belly Flops.  After a couple of handfuls, however, I kind of wished I hadn't.  The printed statements on the bag are correct, but they're more than a ""little less perfect"": for example,  you get quite a few that have no jelly center and consist entirely of candy coating instead.  Then there are some flavors that, for some reason,  taste like they should have come out of a bag of Harry Potter inspired flavors.  In short, this was not an enjoyable experience and it even turned me off jelly beans for a bit."	5	0
1	B0017T2MWW	A245G0NZ7ZGR8O	Great Japanese Product	The just right quantity of Japanese Green tea to be able to either drink at one sitting or save for later.<br />It tastes great because it is not sweet.	1	0

-1	B0018Q1G94	AYPO8X6OWCL34	Very Deceiving	"This pasta tasted absolutely wonderful - but it's very deceiving. If you compare the nutritional facts to that of whole wheat pasta (which is also delicious, and can be bought anywhere) the whole wheat pasta is actually BETTER for you. Dreamfields packaging states that there are ""protected carbohydrates"", but never explain this concept. By which standards are they measuring these ""protected carbohydrates""?? I say this is a great alternative to regular pasta, but it's not exactly what it claims to be - it's still pretty high on the glycemic index."	5	9
1	B001D0KG4Q	A2TIL8GL138JYY	Excellent selection	This box of k-cups has something for everyone: coffee in bold, medium, and decaf, plus tea. We opened it for Thanksgiving and everyone had fun choosing their own flavors.	1	0
-1	B002OG1L4W	A2S5EVQLPRDVUQ	Might make okay dog treats....	I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.	0	0
-1	B000HGGP42	ATHGDJECNTVQ0	Disappointing	Not hot enough. Package was much smaller than expected and price was way too high.  Much better off with Blue Diamond Wasabi or Jalapeno.  Very disappointed.	1	1
-1	B000HZEZTA	A5V9UCW3IHG6H	Hoping for chipotle	I've always trusted Lawry's for good and successful spice. I expected a robust chipotle taste before and after cooking.  We marinated chicken for 45 minutes, well over the recommended time, then baked per instructions.  The uncooked marinade has a very slight chipotle taste; the cooked marinade has no chipotle taste at all, overwhelmed by the taste of what may be cayenne.  It's hard to tell - the taste is very metallic.	1	0
1	B000EUD652	ACYR6O588USK	Good Snacking	These tasty bagel snacks are perfect for snack time.<br /><br />They taste delicious and have good healthy ingrediants.

-1	B000CNB4LE	AXYDMSXPFUHC6	"NOT ""natural"""	Although Zico may claim to be natural, I disagree since it is made from concentrate. I prefer to drink Vita Coco, which is a much more flavorful brand of coconut water and is actually 100% NATURAL!	3	2

-1	B007H13SYA	A13TK5XFMWR1TC	Try for something better	The cheese pack with the popcorn is mostly salt.  Put it on the popcorn and you have salty popcorn.  It's orange but it doesn't taste anything like cheese.  Without the packet it is very bland, dull and only looks like popcorn.  Best to skip this and look for something better.	0	0
1	B000W4OQRW	A13PY9JS75AZ8R	Awesome snack!	"I go to a US University, and to find out that one of the on-campus stores sold this kind of thing surprised me. I didn't even know what they were when I bought them; the fact that the back said ""chocolate"" and they were from Japan sold them to me. But when I got back to the dorm room and started eating them, I just couldn't put them down! The chocolate is unlike any chocolate I've had before, and the cracker part is delicious!<br /><br />I had to force myself to stop eating them, they're that good! Now I just hope I can find them at a local store back home, to continue my addiction in peace..."	2	0
-1	B0052P1PBG	AIDGWEPLL1UUB	Puroast low acid organic house blend coffee	"Order took 14 days to arrive, it is so dry it looks like it has been sitting in the sun for days, it tastes like cardboard(if you ever made ""spitballs"" from paper when you were a kid then you know that taste). I made two pots, adding more coffee to the second pot but ended up throwing the coffee in the trash. I'm glad I only ordered a 12oz sample. I can't say weather the low acid claim is valid but they sure have the low flavor perfected. Don't waste your money. Not worth the money and effort to return it.  Joe in Oregon"	0	0
1	B0026BQKT6	A17BASDYF2LA63	LOVE IT!	We love our WowButter!!!  I has the same consistency as regular peanut butter & the same taste!!  Doesn't get hard with age, not too sweet, and could fool anyone into believing it's really peanut butter.  It's a staple we have to have for my son.	0	0
1	B0012XBD7I	AWM1SL1PYY3A3	Awesome and delicious!	"These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read ""Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!""<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!"	2	0

-1	B004OV6X6Q	A3CLWZGMC7M9Z1	Just Okay	I love Lara Bars so I thought this would be a slam dunk for me. While I did appreciate the large chunks of almonds, the bar itself was too dense and chewy for my liking. The chocolate is also slightly bitter tasting. I had to make myself finish the whole bar. Not a winner in my book, but not the worst I've tried either. Definitely not something I'd go out of my way to purchase.	0	0

-1	B0002ARRCC	A22910598LDDD2	not quite tricky enough and high mess potential	I got this toy because I wanted my cat to work a little for his food.  This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for.  Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes.  It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side.  Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball.  It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting.  I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room.  Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl.  Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus.	19	0

-1	B0002YW26E	A3N99REXKZNENT	Where are the spiders?	Disappointing. I put out 12 traps in my garage, which has hundreds of spiders. After two weeks, only a single spider was in a trap.

-1	B000VXYV6K	A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE	A pain on rocky soil, ugly and cheap	"So here in southern TN we have this horrid red dirt called ""chirt"" it makes any digging a nightmare.  This would not have been an issue with this fence if it had come with metal or even sturdy poles.  But because the cheap plastic poles would break if I attempted to push them into the ground, there was a lot of digging involved.  When I was finished I was rewarded with an ugly appearance around my garden (the plan was to keep the feral cats from using it as a litter box) Then I discovered that I had to find a place to shelter the box as it cannot get wet.  Well my garden isn't next to the house so that doesn't make it all that easy.  Add to it the fact that this ugly thing only stops animals at a specific height who touch both the ground and the wire at the same time, and the stupid cats are just jumping over the ugly thing.<br /><br />Needless to say it has been removed as it is both ugly and serves no purpose.  I'm sure that there are people who this would serve an excellent purpose for.  I am not one of those people"	0	0

You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this.

-1	B003TXIDC2	A1T3AEOF10XQJA	Great ingredients, but...	I thought the unique flavors would be a good enrichment experience for my Cocker Spaniel puppy, and the ingredients list was extremely promising.  No wheat, corn or soy, low calorie, 96% fat free, highly digestible... Sounds amazing, right?<br /><br />Unfortunately, these aren't as soft as they look in the bag.  (I was imagining something the texture of Zuke's Mini Naturals or Cloud Star Tricky Trainers.)  Because they take so long to chew up (I even tried one and it took forever!), they're not really a good training treat, which is a disappointment since StarMark is trying to build a brand around training with rewards.  If they were a little softer, both my puppy and I would be a lot happier with the product.  We really want to like it!	0	0

The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are.

I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.

-1	B000LR7PAK	A36U7NO5WC37HO	Misleading Picture and Description	"This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is ""russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA"".  Notice that this product title starts with ""Alaskan Salmon"", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of ""Grained Salmon Caviar""  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see ""made in USA"" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was ""sorry I was out of town"".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out."	7	1

-1	B000IKALLA	A1O1C1RWAZCW4S	Not what I thought	These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though.	2	1
-1	B0032CJYM8	AY3CGSD5Q1QI2	Not what I expected	I ordered this hoping to get a satisfying fruit snack that was both healthy and delicious. It was a little disappointing. Each packet--though supposedly a serving size of fruit--is in actuality only about one ring of dried pineapple, if that, broken into pieces. I could've done without the added supposed guava flavor--it didn't do anything for the snack. The dehydrated pineapple pieces are basically only flavored by what seems like a dusting of the flavoring fruit--so there's some alteration on the pineapple flavor, but is neither here nor there.<br />It is sweet (almost too sweet) and without added sugars may indeed satisfy some people's (very small...)sweet tooth. Personally, I'd go with bigger size servings--not to mention that it is a waste of resources and energy for packing 5-6 pieces of dried pineapple in each--the rest is air... It is edible, but more much beyond that.<br />I will stick with dried pineapple, non-sweetened, and unsulfured, from the healthfood store.	1	1
-1	B0061IUIDY	A2H4AWIOK1REMX	Too weak	These pricey little air-tight pouches reveal a delightful scent when opened, but the flavors are too light. Neither the tea nor the spices are sufficient to make an enjoyable cup. I have used more tea bags and less water, and finally got to a strength that is palatable, but there isn't enough juice in these things.<br /><br />And the flavor isn't that great. I am not a huge fan of flavored tea; I drink a lot, but usually just straight black tea,. However, back in the olden days I used to drink Constant Comment, and I've enjoyed many cups of chai at my favorite Indian restaurant. It is much better than this stuff.	0	0

1	B0030ZLOUC	A2NH60QE6LPV84	Nothing but the best for my baby! :-)	This is super premium dog food taken to a new level - BREED SPECIFIC. Eukanuba already makes some of the best dog available, and now they have tailored it from large breed to specific breeds. My dog likes the food, it keeps her teeth clean (which helps the breath), and I just feel like I am doing everything I can to meet her nutritional needs. Her coat is in great shape and she has lots of energy. No problems with digesting. The only downside is the cost, but in life, you get what you pay for.	1	0

1	B0041LHND6	A2SQO5FR4MMDT8	Nylabone success	My dog loves to chew plastic things...eyes on teddy bears and plastic lids.  Before she was a strong chewer I had given her other Nylabone products and she really liked them so I thought I'd try the durable bone.  It has a flavor to it so she will chew on it for long periods of time.  She also hasn't chewed plastic things because whenever she goes for them I throw her a durable bone and she chews that instead.  I think she likes the flavor.<br /><br />If your dog isn't an avid chewer Nylabone makes flexible and other flavored bones that come apart easier.  My dog is a year old and she just started chewing a lot.  She has enjoyed the puppy bones and flexible bones.  Now she has graduated to durable.<br /><br />Nylabone is a great product and I plan on using it for a long time.	4	0
1	B00472I5A4	A1IVFBJA9KAI1M	Tasty!	The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!	2	1

In my opinion, the cherry flavor is very tasty, but not quite as flavorful as the others.  Grape is still my personal favorite.	0	0
-1	B0029XDZDK	AV00VANC5H5RG	The name implies strength, dark and bold	"Like all reviews the taste is subjective based on your preference.<br />I had this on my gift list and received it for Christmas.<br /><br />So now it came time to taste test it.  First off my reference point is ""Jet Fuel"", ""Double Black Diamond"", and Donut Shop"" all from the Coffee People and each being in my top choice category.  I tend to favor strong dark roast flavors.<br /><br />Judgment criteria for my coffee is; aroma, taste, and color.  If it doesn't have aroma it typically goes nowhere and is tasteless.  At that point color doesn't matter.  Some have good aroma but lack the full taste to complement the aroma, and the color should be indicative of the coffee type, either rich brown or rich black.<br /><br />Well I tried the ""Black Tiger"" and must say: NO aroma, NO taste, OK on color.<br /><br />So in summary 46 k-cups (I tested 2) will be shipped off to the land fill unused."	0	1

"To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your ""wrathful"" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs."	4	0

1	B001D0KG4Q	A3EU2AZGVCG3N	Great Coffee and Variety, but includes Tea and Decaf	As many other reviews have mentioned, there is not a clear description of what is included in the box. I will not bother to repost the lists others have made, however I can say the variety is MUCH greater than the Gloria Jean's or Green Mountain Coffee variety packs I've tried (both of which include only Four blends of coffee), which is a definite plus. And I always set my Keurig to the smallest cup-size setting and feel this is the right level for maximizing the flavor of each k-cup - haven't tested how these taste with larger cups. Good brand overall, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Be sure to know that this package includes both TEA and DECAF COFFEE - you will be sorely disappointed if you're left with those at the end of the box because you didn't want them in the first place.	0	0

1	B001EQ55ZO	A2AY83K9N60V38	suprisingly good!	I love cashews but often steer clear of anything I haven't tried (yep creature of habit) however, when 'Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews' came up for review I figured - what the heck - might as well give them a try.  The pepper is just enough to add an enticing spiciness to the nuts without overpowering them and the seasalt is perfect.<br /><br />I figured I'd snack on a few and save the rest for later, well I'd eat a few close it up and minutes later open the container right back up to nab a 'few' more.<br /><br />Will this replace my standard flavors - no, but I definitely won't overlook them and assume they aren't going to be to my liking anymore - I now know better.<br /><br />Of course my husband is laughing at me because he's been eating salt and pepper potato chips for about the past year and I refused to even try them.	0	1

-1	B004TPKAN4	A1LJR5IS0B6ADX	An unfair take on the flavor of ginger	"At the end of the day I am a fan of the flavor that is ""ginger"".  Ginger has a taste that is both smooth yet has a zing, which makes it very versatile for food.  It has found a home in the realm of Asian cuisine, the ginger man cookie would be lost without it and nothing says ""adult soda"" like a glass of ginger ale.  And this is only the beginning of what you can do with ginger (root).  Yet it must be remembered that a little can go a long way.<br /><br />This brings us to this ""ginger snap"" cookie by ""Newman's Own"".  In a word I would have to describe this cookie as ""awful"".  It is too gingery, to the point that my mouth feels like I just ate too much hot sauce once the cookie is chewed and swallowed, in other words bad after taste. The cookie has no balance in flavor; it is just straight up ginger, a sweet aspect would be nice. If I wanted to experience that much ginger I would just chew on ginger root. The cookie itself is as hard as a rock.  I was actually concerned I might chip my teeth when biting into this cookie and this is no hyperbole.  Not to mention that the back of almost every cookie in the bag were burnt.<br /><br />The bag itself is very small and the cost is rather high for what the product really is.  This cookie is also made with organic ingredients.  The one category of food marketing that fails to impress me is organic foods.  For the most part they aren't any healthier and are way too expensive.  So at the end of the day I would suggest on passing on this cookie and go for an old school Pepperidge Farm ginger man cookie."	3	1

I didn't like the pretzels in them, or the sesame crunch thingys, but the peanuts and nuts were quite tasty. The hot and spicy flavor was noticeable in these but not the others. If you need to provide snacks for a lot of people these would do the job, since you do get quite a lot of it for the price. I found that after munching on these for awhile, it feels like eating the same thing, all the flavors and textures just combine into one.	3	0
1	B005VOONLW	A20H1M28WLI9J2	Lovely Coffee, Shhh, Here's a Tip!	"I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a ""strong"" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee. I ripped open a couple of bags and made a 10 cup pot in my MR Coffee Coffeemaker (bought right here on amazon.com and was an ""open-box"" absolute bargain) and found it made a really fantastic pot of coffee. I ended up using it all in this manner.<br />I like the idea of this coffee, it is grown in an ethical manner in Jamaica and also in Africa and Central America)by the Marley family (of Reggae fame)<br /><br />A quick look on their web-site reveals they have several other offerings plus a neat (if pricey) coffee-maker)<br />If you like a great tasting coffee, this is worth a try even though it is a bit pricey!"	1	1
-1	B000VK8AVK	A37JB1DGWBIDDS	Gross!	I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.

-1	B0046HGTJ4	A33ZYFE8XMKKR1	Warp Speed Quinoa, Tasty but Overpriced	After hearing about benefits of quinoa, I stumbled across this product in Costco. It struck me a bit expensive but I decided to give it a try anyway. While the rice/quinoa blend is quite tasty, the product is overpriced given what bulk rice and quinoa cost. Personally, I don't shop organic so any premium for this attribute is something I don't value. What is valued is the speed of preparation. These pouches can be microwaved in 90 seconds. Just rip a small vent, place in the microwave and 90 seconds later, you have a meal. No water is needed.<br /><br />The taste is superior to rice alone in my personal opinion. There is a notable taste difference compared to other rice-dishes, so the added variety could be worth the price premium for individuals who don't have the time cook rice and quinoa conventionally.<br /><br />One of the touted benefits of Quinoa is the protein content.  Yet, this product only has 6 grams of protein for every 240 calorie serving.  This is a lower protein/calorie ratio than whole grain bread.  Protein has four calories per gram, which would mean that 240 calories of pure protein could yield 60 grams of protein.  Realistically, high protein foods would have four to six times as much protein as this product per calorie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy, high carbohydrate snack or small meal, give the Seeds of Change quinoa/rice a shot. Longer term, you would be much better off making a similar dish using bulk incredients at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Fast preparation<br />Tasty<br />Potential health benefits<br /><br />Cons<br />LOW protein content<br />Expensive	1	0

-1	B001OCKIP0	A2PN65B6BSTIYZ	A Good Out of The Bag Snack	I was interested to try Back To Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola because I'm always looking for new healthy snacks or yogurt mix ins.  I was unsure what to expect though, because I've had hit and miss experiences with Back to Nature products before--I've enjoyed some of their cookies, but found most of their breakfast cereals to be too sweet.<br /><br />Like the earlier products, I found this granola to be a mixed bag.  I thought it was good out of the bag--just enough crunch, not too much chocolate--a good healthy-ish snack for kids who get turned off by regular granola that is often full of seeds and nuts.  But then when I added this granola to milk or yogurt I felt like the taste wasn't as good. I don't know if it was the dairy-chocolate reaction or the granola getting a bit soggy pretty fast, but I just didn't like the cereal as much when it wasn't dry.<br /><br />So my verdict is mixed--this is a good snacking granola, but not such a good cereal granola in my book.	0	0

-1	B007I7YZJK	A23RZIU0N8K2KR	All I taste is Splenda	This product has sugar, honey, sucralose, and maltodextrin.

1	B000E4ALHY	AWC6RMU31978F	Incredibly Good; Puts Pop-Tarts to Shame	"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"	0	0

Of course, this cereal can't be good for a diabetic or one allergic to peanuts (I am neither, or I wouldn't be writing a review). As a matter of fact, having just eaten a bowl prompted me to type this up! (This is my third review on a food product, by the way.)<br /><br />Eat this in moderation.

Overall, the flavor reminds me of certain Thai curries, probably due to the coconut. What you actually get here are two foil envelopes of curry mixture and coconut powder. Chile peppers are certainly there, but hot pepper fans will want to add more. Officially, this kit is for Rendang Curry with beef, but the back of the box states that chicken or lamb would be equally appropriate. I used beef, and made only half of the recipe, as I was the only one eating...the package says that the opened envelopes will keep for three days, so I froze the remainder for future use.  The full recipe calls for nearly two pounds of meat and no added vegetables; if you choose to add vegetables you will have enough curry to feed a small family, so I'd advise that. In any case, this dish can be prepared very quickly, and has a pleasant flavor served with rice. Whether or not the Prima Taste is worth its price is a judgment call, but I probably wouldn't get it again, just because I like to make my own curry. But you can prepare a quick, easy and tasty meal with this product. Prima Taste offers several such sauce kits, and they may be worth a try as well.	0	0

1	B001ACPPXE	A3SV1TGK2V6KOR	Tricks to Make it Better	I've done the several batches of this mix. Before anyone claims they hate it, try these simple tricks.<br /><br />1. Add 1 tsp of baking powder -> adds fluff (1 tsp for every cup of flour)<br /><br />2. If allergic to eggs -> use Ener-G egg replacement. Follow the directions. Add 1 tsp of olive oil (help with the texture since the egg fat isn't present)<br /><br />3. DO NOT OVER MIX! GO slow if you have to. Watch a video on knowing when the dough is elastic so you know when to stop. (One of the flours in this batch gets hard from over mixing - will update when I remember which one)<br /><br />4. Keep the 3 tbsp of oil (I used olive oil) Chebe calls for. If you replace with applesauce, it will add as a binder. Trust me, you do NOT want two binders in a recipe.<br /><br />5. Take your time rolling the dough to make it nice and tight. This keeps the Cinnamon mix in the middle.<br /><br />6. To heat up the rolls again, DO NOT USE THE MICROWAVE! Use a toaster oven or a nonstick pan with a cover. I personally use the pan and steam heat the rolls again.<br /><br />These tricks may not work for all. I will update when I learn more and feel free to post your own tricks.	1	0

-1	B006BXUY2Y	A1LGB9RZX3SR0P	I only got a 5-pack	"I'm not sure if it was because I received my product via Vine, but I noticed that the product description is for a pack of SIX bars, but my box was a FIVE pack (it's even written on the front of the box).  It's a regular retail package and looks just like the picture on Amazon, so I'm just hoping that mine isn't indicative of what's being sold here.  Still, it could be a fluke, so I'm not knocking off any stars for that, however, caveat emptor.<br /><br />No, my three-star rating is because these bars just weren't very good granola bars.<br /><br />On the positive side, these bars are relatively low in calories (110), fat (3g), sodium (85mg) and sugar (7g), and have 4g of dietary fiber.  What I didn't care for was the taste (or lack thereof).  I understand that chewy granola bars tend to be more ""airy,"" but this bar just isn't as dense as other granola bars, so it doesn't feel satisfying.  And, despite the dark chocolate, it had a soy/fiber taste that reminded me a bit of cardboard.  This is coming from someone who drinks regularly soy milk and needs to consume large amounts of fiber daily.  Plus, the dark chocolate taste wasn't that strong, it was just sweet, making it a sweet, chewy, oaty mass that left me feeling like having another snack, defeating the purpose of this snack bar.  I suppose the best way to describe it to someone is, and pardon me for being cliche and vague, ""It's only okay.""<br /><br />Also, I hope the way my box of granola bars was shipped was due to the fact that I was getting it free on Vine and this will not be how it'll be shipped to other customers.  My box was shipped in a large, padded envelope, so the box inside was completely smashed, as were most of the bars inside.  It looked like it had been sat on and folded a few times.  Horrible.  I'm usually pretty pleased with Amazon's shipping, so this was a shock and disappointment.  I realize this isn't an issue with the product itself, so I'm not deducting any stars for it, but I felt it bad enough to warrant a mention.<br /><br />I eat all sorts of granola, energy, and protein bars, and though I realize that this one is a ""diet"" snack, I've had others with more taste and felt more filling, but if you're the type to reach for a candy bar when your stomach growls, this could be a healthier alternative."	0	0
1	B001EO64EM	A3VKBFC5K2INR4	great tea but beware	I have purchased many different teas from SerendipiTea and have been more than pleased with them. This tea sounded great until i read the ingredients on the box. I am a vegan and it contains traces of dairy. It did not say this on the website. So i have to give it to someone else. But it smells amazing.	1	0
1	B000EQYW0E	AF7DZ97VNSEWN	I agree with Richard, an excellent find	Do without the salt.  These chips are great, and you can taste the excellent unique blue corn.  This company is very savvy, so that these chips are also very healthful for other reasons.  I eat some about every day.  They are really irresistable, so I like the healthful aspect.  Be careful not to eat too many!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]	0	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A17HMM1M7T9PJ1	Another great dark K-cup coffee	"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY"">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ"">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"	14	1
-1	B004FEN3GA	A3CBCVHIK3G76X	Good, reasonably healthy for a cookie	"When I think of Newtons, I think of the incredibly portable snack that I could take along on long bike rides for energy.  They wouldn't really crumble away and were fairly healthy.  Since my biking days, they have expanded their flavor choices, and now they have expanded the product line further.<br /><br />These Fruit Thins *are* thin.  A package contains roughly 28 cookies, in two rows in one of those little plastic trays.  It was a great number for me, as there are seven of us, so they split up evenly.  Of course, I took the two that arrived as total crumbs, and the one that was broken... so this review is based on one whole cookie and a lot of pieces.<br /><br />My husband declared that, ""these taste like blueberry muffin crackers!""  I don't happen to agree with the cracker part, exactly.  My kids (ages 5-13) all loved them and commented that it tasted like real blueberries, not that fakey stuff.  Opening the package, it even smells like real blueberries.<br /><br />These aren't as healthy as I would expect from Newtons, but they are decent.  This is something I would consider purchasing for my family.  I love that the ingredient list doesn't include anything I don't recognize.  Next time, I think I want to try the chocolate raspberry though..."	0	0
-1	B000CQE3HS	A39JPO0LE1A8MX	Not that great	These are greasy and not very good.  I suppose some people may like it but I  left them in our work break room so others would take them down.  They are beef and not a pork mixture so that's good for people who don't eat pork.	1	1
-1	B001EO5SC6	A1P3Z1ROTZSX4	NOT All Natural	My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading.<br /><br />Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money.	62	3
1	B001EO64ZQ	A2MQILM9YVE6E0	LOVE THIS SAUCE!	Not sure what anyone else uses this sauce for, but we use it with our roast beef sandwiches and it's amazingly good. Also, I use it for my roasted vegetables or roasted potatoes. It's delicious as a coating with garlic powder, rice flour, and pepper. It is sweet, but not sickeningly so. We love it!	0	0
1	B005IQHGG2	A2K7ZSSBUHAQ5O	small tube filled with freeze-dried ice cream balls	There really isn't much to say about this.  If you like freeze-dried ice cream, you'll probably like this.  Like all freeze-dried ice cream, it seems ridiculously overpriced for what you get, but that's the way it goes.  About a quarter of the tube is filled with smooshed crumbs, but it eats the same.  The tube is small, of course - about 1.5 times the height of a chapstick and maybe twice the diameter.  It has white, brown, and pink balls (white seems to be the largest).  I listed them by color because I can't really say that they taste like vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry because they are so small.  All in all, I think I prefer the small bricks better than these little balls, but I kind of enjoyed flipping the top and pouring some into my mouth.	0	0
