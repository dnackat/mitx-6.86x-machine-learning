-1	B000LKVHYC	A3NAKOMAS0I5L9	Bad even for 'healthy'	I had high hopes for this, but it was bad.  Really bad.  The whole pan of cupcakes made from this had to be thrown out.  Very gritty and dense.	0	0
-1	B003QRQRY2	ARBO3XW14MNGA	Alot of money for one can	I guess it's only one can since there is nothing in the description about how many cans you get. I guess we can't all be intelligent.	1	1
-1	B008EG58V8	A1IQXGT4MJUYJ8	"The Box says ""OATMEAL SQUARES"" which I believe is FALSE advertising."	"""Oatmeal Squares"" is in about the largest print you can fit on the Front of the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour. So how can it rightfully be called a ""Crunchy Oat Cereal"".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker, which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.  This is really ""Oatmeal and Wheat Squares""<br /><br />Who cares how it tastes if it is not what it says it is."	0	0
1	B004WZZY8M	A2TBL6WAZGXB9P	Delicious!	I really enjoyed this flavor, this has a very nice subtle coconut flavor that is not too sweet.  It's a hit in our household, I give them to my grand kids every time they come over and needless to say they keep coming back!	1	0

-1	B002QTXS5C	A2X8URSBQ7D4IJ	Not The Best Cookies I've Ever Had!	I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks..	0	0
1	B00141UC9I	A2UVATCLGYKFV3	GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!	My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order.	0	0
1	B0039QW2EE	A1GXS7Z4U2ONW4	Good Find!	I've been looking for dried bell peppers ever since I ran out of a small bag that I bought in Amish country.  This stuff is great in chili and soups, keeps for months, and doesn't require chopping!	5	0
1	B002GJ9JWS	A3V1A3C9DTLPME	Pretty tasty and very handy for the health conscious	Dont go into this thinking after you mix up your peanut butter that it will taste like what you are familiar with. It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead. For me though, this is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!	0	0
1	B000GG1O8A	A2YQ2ZI65F37N8	light flavor	If you are looking for a lightly flavored green tea with mint, then this is the product.  It is great for the days I want a mild flavored tea.	0	0
-1	B001T9J552	A2CPKC5LIUAMGE	Too expensive	I find this to be a good product...good spicy flavor and a quick start to an easy meal.  I have since seen this same product, same quantity at my local Costco for a significant amount less. ($10.00 for a case of 12)  I thought that Amazon was supposed to be a good deal????	0	0
-1	B0029NVJX8	AJLEWBV6DH1E6	Made my cat sick	My cat had a very bad reaction to these treats. He loved them, but they were like an extreme laxative. It took me a while to track down his problem. Maybe it was the chlorophyll, I don't know, but if your cat has a sensitive stomach, I'd be careful with these particular treats.	3	1
1	B001LGGH40	A37NHGD0WTRYFH	Its a pleasant fizz	"The names of these juice drinks rarely really reflect the majority of what is actually in them.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I've never heard of acerola and I want to know what the ""natural flavors"" are.  Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the ""flavor"".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?  (BTW I have this gripe about most nutrition labels).<br /><br />So, its a good drink, probably good for you and definitely better than soda."	1	0
-1	B000ESJR20	ATB6MGDQGZZGD	Not impressed	I like the Starbucks Via instant coffee, but would rather support another company instead of Starbucks every day, and I wanted to have organic coffee. I got this based on the great reviews, but I didn't like the taste of the coffee, nor was I impressed at how well it dissolved in water. I begrudgingly drank it every day until it was gone.	0	0
-1	B000K6DVDM	A3OI5NNRMDDCAG	They make great tea, but can't count.	My wife and I love the tea and have ordered this product twice.  Based on taste alone, the product gets 5 stars.  So, why 3 stars overall?<br /><br />The first package was short 3 bags, the last short by 1 bag.  We love the tea and are willing to pay a premium for it.  We do, however, expect to get what we pay for.  We are trying to get Mighty Leaf to send us the missing bags or give us a credit.  No word yet.<br /><br />We suggest that you count your bags when you get the package to make sure that you're not getting short changed.	6	0
1	B001AJ1ULS	A2D6H3OE31ZGBS	These are GREAT!  Superior Service !	My Dobes would barely let me put the box on the kitchen to open it!  Terrific product at a great price and superior customer service.	0	0
-1	B001EO62BM	A3KO0JEF9R74FD	Bland	I tried to use these dried morels as a substitute for fresh morels in a chicken dish and they were lacking in flavor. Morels should perfume a dish and these mushrooms did nothing when rehydrated.	0	0
-1	B0017GUZ7E	A16QS5AADG7RAM	Great Coffee, not for espresso.	Perhaps is the fact that its called Gold quality makes us believe its Lavazza's best, but really its a drip coffee and not a bad one. for now ill stick to Illy.	0	0
1	B000CQE3HS	A2DCS0VQMMHP8X	I love these.	I've tried just about every knock off, wanna-be slim jim there is and nothing comes close to the original. These are perfect snacks if you are on a low carb diet. Wonderful texture and the right amount of spices. The ones I received from Amazon were much fresher than the ones I buy at Target.	1	0
1	B002FYJVHW	A17MTAYH3SHPGJ	Clean flavor, incredible price, convenient storing, everyone should buy this...	This is exactly what I wanted and because of the packaging you do not need to refrigerate before you open them.  I do wish that amazon sold unsweetened regular soy milk for this price but alas...they do not.  I am not in anyway disappointed with this product though and while I cannot use it as a dairy substitute when I am cooking, I love it in the morning or for making protein shakes. You will not regret buying this and you can take all year to drink them if you want.	1	0
1	B000S4HVPU	A1C19WLTO01L95	Great Egg Noodles	I was so happy to find these after eating at a German restaurant and sampling spaetzle noodles.  These work well in many dishes from soups to casseroles and the size of the box is (9 ounces)is a good size for two people.  Delicious and a Great Product!	0	0
-1	B001AS1A4Q	A3S5643F4JNLQQ	ehhhhh	Like everything, some things work for some and some things don't. For a while it seemed to help me pretty quickly with the alertness, waking me up, and energy. I bought a few boxes and over the period of about 3 months used them on and off. To me they lost their effect quite quickly. I am not sure whether I got used them, whether it was in my head and never really worked (don't think this is the case), or whether they just stopped working...in my head. In the end I decided if it wasn't working for whatever reason, then why put it in my body.<br />  One last thing, I bought this flavor due to the lower price, but in my opinion the grape is much better tasting and not as bitter as this one.	0	0
-1	B00450XKUI	A301ZN1BR9ZBR4	Wrong flavor	"Just want to warn you that ""fun flavor"" are strange berry flavors and NOT the traditional ones I expectd, like lime, orrange, cherry and grape.  I was very disappointed."	1	1
-1	B000GZUA7W	A36WGHR8TO5DKT	"That ""Magical Fruit"" Issue...."	I felt I had to warn people about this product.  It's not that it's a bad company, or bad product per se.  Powdered hummus isn't all that great, but I do see the benefit and convenience of it.<br /><br />The problem is the effect one experiences after consuming it.  While every other form of hummus I've tried over the years hasn't caused such a problem, for some reason this company's powdered product does.  And it's bad, like, painful bad.<br /><br />So, I suggest if you haven't tried it yet, perhaps buy one box locally and try it first, before committing to a full pack.	0	0
-1	B003VXL0V6	A1CSRU8Z5KIPV6	barely any vanilla aroma or flavor	"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."	2	0
-1	B00141OU50	AJ0I6W0X075VT	OMG....CHINA	My dogs loved these treats!!  Recently my 9 yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick.  Couldn't keep anything down and after 3 days of this we went to pet emergency.  $1200.00 later it was concluded that it was something digested.  Not possible, I spare no expense when it comes to my 3 furry buddy's!  I grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough, MADE IN CHINA.  Went to FDA web site in 2012 and they said chicken from CHINA bad but no recalls yet.  DOGS have been getting sick from chicken products from china, advised not to buy.  Called company and no return call.<br />Trashed them all!!	7	1
1	B003QNJYXM	A1KAJL2Y3AB8E1	Professional Driver On A Closed Course! :-)	"Like most of the reviews posted here, I give this product a positive rating. For me, it does what it claims to do... and I especially appreciate the ""no crash"" effect after a few hours! I first found out about this product when I started racing Go-Karts this year... I hit the local Stop-N-Shop before getting to the track and decided to plunk out the $3.00, as I was a bit tired. I threw it in my cooler and then drank it just prior to my qualifying session. Almost immediately, I could feel the ""boost""... and it helped out on track! I never felt the Niacin rush that some claim, but the one thing I did notice, was that my jaw was a bit tight due to the jolt of energy. I only have few suggestions: I've tried all the flavors, and I think the Orange flavor is the best; I drink the product chilled... tastes better to me that way; the flavor is a bit too sweet for me so I add it into my personal water bottle; I buy this on amazon because it's a lot cheaper than buying it at my local Stop-N-Shop!"	0	0
-1	B007NIARRS	A3KN3YR213VMAL	Glad I ordered just one.	My daughter hated this. I was going to order more, glad I didn't.  Love the ingredients but has no taste so unfortunately she didn't like it. I can't shove it down her throat.	0	0
1	B000I1RHMU	A3DIN3TCSZTISM	I love this relaxing tea!	This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity.	2	0
1	B004T434L0	A9QYU3IG3BVRP	MM MMM Good	If you've never tried this you're missing out...this product is great for camping trips or at home/at work.  I bought the 4 pack and I've already gone through two of the boxes in about 2 weeks.<br /><br />The flavor is great, it doesn't have that odd chemical taste you so often get with artificial sweeteners, and the creamer it's mainly composed of makes for a nice thick drink, almost like a cappuccino from the store.<br /><br />Highly suggest you get some and try it.	0	0
-1	B002BTQQBA	A1GCNDSZ4G3GYT	DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear. Luckily I only given about 10 pieces in the week that I purchased the jerky. I immediately stopped giving him the treats since that was the only new item introduced. Lucky for me, my dog was able to recover from the issues brought on by the jerky. Don't ever buy anything that you can ingest which is made in China. Or better yet, just don't buy anything made in china.	2	0

1	B004ZIER34	AT1RF4WNPGGLC	Surpassed my expectations.	"I normally stay away from anything labeled ""dark roast"", but I'm glad I took a chance on Puroast (low-acid) Coffee. The lower acid sure does cut down on the bitterness usually associated with dark roasts. My stomach handled this dark french roast better than my off brand medium roast. My only complaint, is the price of this coffee. It averages about one dollar per ounce, which I think is a bit extreme, I liked it, but it didn't blow me away. So if you don't mind the price tag, I would recommend it. Good stuff."	0	0

-1	B002AQP516	A3DJNOS6VJUYS4	Quick and easy	I am not a huge fan of instant potatoes but these are better than many others on the market. They are quick and easy to fix when your running late and everyone seems to like them. Amazon makes it even easier by selling at a comparable price to the stores and shipping. It's nice to have them on hand when I'm rushed or unexpected guests show up and I need more in a hurry.	2	1
-1	B001EQ4RWQ	A1S8T5VWBW3FXF	BC500	"Based on all the highly quality products turned out by Hershey this one totally missed the mark.

-1	B002DLXXHG	A3VSH31QO2C895	It has MSG	It has MSG.  That was not mentioned on any of the description nor on the manufacture's web-site.  Other than that, it tasted okay and the texture was average.	2	3
-1	B005VOOLXM	A199V9Y5ER1L5P	Brew seems a bit weak for my tastes	I evaluated this coffee blend while travelling.  Most hotel rooms come equipped with single-brew coffee makers, do this product received a thorough testing.<br /><br />My first impression is that this blend is a bit weak; in fact, a good coffee bite was obtained with about a 50% reuction in water used.<br /><br />Flavor was merely OK.  I wouldn't go out of the way to purchase more examples of Marley.	0	1
1	B00437I4VI	A3NMPL7RNPQ62J	Healthy easy to grab and eat snack	I love these, strawberry good too. I tried the fruit strips from Target, but they were SOOOPER GOOEY STICKY and it was thick and gelatiny, it just wasn't very good in my opinion. These fruit roll ups are fantastic though, similar to the original fruit roll ups, but a little granier, and tears more easily. The taste is pretty amazing, but beware for those who are allergic to citrus, because it has lemon juice in it despite it being wildberry or strawberry. Overall I recommend it for those who need an easy snack and aren't allergic to citrus or any other ingredients it contains.	0	0
1	B002YKKUMW	A2Q34OXE0V35EL	Long ship time, but great product!	This took an extremly long time to get after I ordered it, but my puppy absolutely loves them, and they are very healthy for her bone and joint development! Less likly to choke on the sticks they are softer than the jerky, but she loves all the Loving Pet products, even the jerky, but reccomend keeping a close eye on them with the jerky. Great all natural product line!	0	0
-1	B002WD98NS	A1CDRS1GDBW2F7	Hard to swallow	I've pretty much liked the other varieties for the Tassimo other than this one. I put my usual amount of creamer and sugar in, was ready to head out the door for work when I took a sip. Fortunately, I did because this tasted just awful. It wasn't bitter or bold. It just tasted lousy. I ran to the fridge dumped a load of Hazelnut flavored creamer in there to mask the nastiness, was about to head out again and it was still too gross to drink. So, long story short, basically, this morning I had a great big mug of Hazelnut creamer with a little bit of coffee in it.<br /><br />This one definitely isn't for me. I'd rather just have a cup of Maxwell House Breakfast Blend and and some flavored creamer to it.	0	0
-1	B000TK6LBS	AZJHB1BU40E1Q	Caribou: an average cup of coffee.	The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...	0	0
-1	B005BCC51E	A3ONP7D1T1XP3N	If I could give it Zero stars, I would.	I usually like all cereals chocolate so I decided to get this one from the internet since its not available in my area. Plus, I like the good ole Captain so its a winner right? Not at all! This stuff was disgusting, I had to throw out what was in my bowl, and the rest of the box, my kid niece and nephew didn't even want it. The only thing I could salvage was the chocolatey tasting milk it left behind, which was good. I hope this stuff disappears before it gets around and taints the brand! Yuck!	1	1
1	B003EM7J9Q	A2KZNUJKINCV33	Totally wonderful if not overcooked	Unlike microwave popcorn, you cannot hear the pork skins cooking, so only by trial and error and the wattage of your microwave will you know how long to cook these. Cooked to the proper timing, they will be fluffy, melt in you mouth. 15 seconds too long you will have a stinky unedible product.<br />It is something that you must try. I cooked mine for 1 minute 45 seconds and they were not all done. I do not know the wattage of my microwave.<br />So try them for your self. As I said, they are different than popcorn, but have the same results if left too long in the micowave, stinky.	0	0
1	B001EQ4RBM	A14DJM89L24C35	Delicious!	Seriously, these things are delicious.  Amazon is a great place to buy them too.  At my local grocer they are $6 a can.  Can't go wrong!	2	0
-1	B003XDH6M6	A1VM6A7HC6CEIH	A Sticky Sweet Treat	"These are certainly interesting candies, and a pleasant alternative to much of the less ""natural"" that's on the market. The pomegranate taste is unusual, almost a slight bitter-sweet combination that stays around after the candy has gone...although I should add that the liquorice has a tendency to get into your teeth in ways that you almost wish it couldn't. It's very chewy and sticky so be warned.<br /><br />Not the cheapest ""candy"" on the market, but certainly an enjoyable occasional treat."	0	0
1	B001189I3A	A2493GV60OOOBI	Great Product!	I first heard about this product from my mother-in-law, and then I did a lot of research about it online. My job is time-consuming, so my problem has always been massive dark circles under my eyes. I bought this product in the hopes that it would help make them disappear.<br /><br />I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and although my dark circles are not completely gone, I can definitely tell a difference. I use this creme every morning between washing my face and applying make-up. You need VERY LITTLE product between both eyes...hardly even a pump. This was a nice fact, since the bottle appears so small for the price. This product illuminates my under-eyes, especially when applied under my foundation. It has a very prominent coffee scent, which is also a nice perk (haha) when I'm getting ready early in the morning.<br /><br />I would suggest not using this product right before bed, because the coffee scent may way you up.<br /><br />To summarize:<br />PROS - very little needed, great coffee scent, early-morning pick-me-up, seems to be working on my under-eye circles<br />CONS - a little pricy (but again, you really dont need much at all with each application), great coffee scent may keep you from falling asleep at night	0	0

1	B001ELJK82	AU1GQJGCX3H5L	Rosso Magnifico - Excellent Wine at 5 Gallons!	I am not sure if I would still consider myself a beginner, anymore, but I am relatively new to this.  Only making wine for a little over a year... In the past year, however, I made about 11 kits from different manufactures.<br /><br />This wine, Tuscany Rosso Magnifico, is quite fantastic.  I made it at 5 gallons by putting in all of the juice concentrate, but only re-constituting with water up to the 5 gallon mark.  I also added 30 Grams of Oak Chips.  Now, I personally don't like a lot of oak in a wine.  For that reason, I don't like many commercial wines...  30 Grams of Oak is enough not to actually taste excessive oak, but have a better mouth feel.  I got the oak from a home brew close to where I live.  Medium Toasted Oak.  Again, it is just my opinion, but less is more with the oak... You should trust your tongue, and not worry about what others say.  You can always add more oak, you can't take it away...<br /><br />I put the oak in the carboy for the secondary fermentation.  Not in the bucket.  I learned that from copying a Mosti Mondale kit.  Some kits but oak dust in the primary...  So far, I have had good luck with the oak chips in the secondary.<br /><br />The wine does taste much better, if you let it sit in the bottle 6 months after you bottle it.  But, you will most likely not be able to wait that long....  Put 3 or 4 bottles away to age, if you can't wait for the whole batch...<br /><br />To learn about the process, I learned everything I know from looking at the videos on the finevinewines.com website.  It may be helpful if you never did it, to look at the process and once you see it, you will be confident that you can do it...  You can also look to youtube for a few good demonstrations...<br /><br />You will need some equipment to do this, but you don't need more than a beginner equipment kit to be successful.  Once you do it, you will be hooked...  I typically do two or three at a time... At the time of this writing, I am doing WE Nero D'Avalo, WE Chocolate Raspberry Port, Vino Italiano Merlot.  When I get a free carboy, I will do the Rosso Magnifico again.  Mrs.Claus got  it to me for Christmas.<br /><br />By the way, everyone who has tried my Rosso Magnifico loves it...<br /><br />See what I mean.  You will get hooked...<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you out there.<br /><br />Cheers!	3	0

Pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea, which neither their dry kibble (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Kitten) nor their alternative wet food (Fancy Feast Classic grain-free varieties) do. I don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them, and of course it's a messy experience for me. Not a fan of this product.	0	1

1	B000EH0RU2	A8CYVX1OFJU1K	Never thought I'd be buying groceries from Amazon.com	My store stopped stocking this rice for some reason.  It is a far superior blend than anything else I've tried and so I Googled it and was surprised to find it here.  Great texture and flavor (I cook it in chicken stock).  The best thing about this rice is that it is ready to cook, no rinsing required.  With other rice blends it takes so long to rinse that sometimes it's not even worth the effort for little reward.  This rice has it all...flavor, texture and no rinsing.  A lazy cooks dream.	0	0

-1	B0030VBRIU	A2CW96MG1IB65L	I wish my toddler liked it	I really wish my toddler liked this. It seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet.

-1	B00329Q5DM	AXLEXZ750G5SE	Bought at my local supermarket	I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.	0	4
-1	B002ESMHOI	A3JMKGGF3EVCEO	Great coffee but the price keeps going up.	Wonderful tasting coffee. This was the only kind of coffee we bought in our house for a long time.

-1	B004OW342G	A7ICHINJY1Q01	Meh.	I've tried several brands of coconut water now, and this is my least favorite. I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but this had kind of a weird taste to me, not as gentle as others. Also, I was looking forward to the pulp, as I love the kelapa muda (young coconut) drinks in Indonesia that have the soft pulp of young coconut in the coconut water. I was hoping to recreate that experience(without the added sugar they include in Indo), but I was disappointed. This is not young coconut pulp, which is scooped out of the coconut and is very soft and sweet, but small,hard chunks cut from a mature coconut. The hard chunks mixed in a coconut was not at all the same textural experience as kelapa muda, and I didn't like it as the contrast between pulp and water was too extreme. To each his own, of course, and some people love it.	7	1
1	B0058AMY74	A3TA1UJWRJF9NC	4 Stars for price and taste	I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.	2	1
-1	B001LG945O	A1I25F9S8ZR6ET	I wanted to like it more	I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages.	0	0

-1	B005K4Q37A	A19LUT6NUQZF3A	ingredients should be listed	I was disappointed to see that this product contains Sucralose.  It also contains sugar so why the need for an artificial sweetener too?  I now have 54 kcups of a product that I really don't care to put in my body.<br />Some people are sensitive to artificial sweeteners, like my daughter who immediately went to the bathroom after drinking a cup, so the should definitely be listed.	0	2
1	B000EM0JS2	A7DB8HLO06BPW	The Best	Yes, it's high in fat - it's also the best canned soup I've ever had.

-1	B0002ML9U6	A2LAM2H5SSIUQH	Questionable........	"I bought Richard's Organics Pet Calm for our Yorkie to calm her down when we travel. My husband and I are long haul truck drivers and at first our youngest Yorkie was okay traveling over the road. However, when we travel over rough roads (and there are a lot of rough roads out there) she starts to pant and shake. She will take Richard's Organics Pet Calm readily enough (it has a sweet taste to it) and does get that ""sleepy eyed"" look, but I didn't see enough of a calming reaction to justify buying it again. However, I haven't tried it under ""normal"" stress circumstances, such as at home during a thunderstorm. I think that for milder stress situations, that Richard's Organics Pet Calm might work."	1	1

The chocolate is tasty, choc PB is more of an acquired taste, but good nonetheless. The only disappointment lies in the sugar content...not low sugar. Ooops. Not quite the ideal product but close enough. I'll still buy it - if they stock it in a local store. Can't keep ordering this online, it's pricey. Try Carbawhey ([...]) a similar soft-serve by the same makers of Arctic Zero in stores near you - you can get an entire quart for [....]max, about the same price as ordering Arctic Zero online.<br /><br />**Would love to see a variety pack with all 4 flavors (not currently offered)...	1	0
1	B000F9Z1XW	A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV	Like a wafer cookie with creamier filling	I wasn't sure what to expect with these, but they are like a sugar wafer with a light, creamy peanut butter filling. I was pleased with the fact that they aren't as sweet as many cookies are and the filling is pleasantly fatty on the tongue. They aren't really reminiscent of Nutter Butter cookies, except that they do have a peanut butter filling, but are delicious nonetheless. The only small point about them which I don't like is that it is difficult to break the cookies apart. They tend to tear off in ragged and uneven blocks. This is a trivial matter, but makes portion control a little more troublesome and creates more crumbs in the bag.	0	0
1	B0009QU7L2	A1RT25FGJV176C	Great Product	This is a great product.  This and sea salt are the only salts I use.  Being on a low-sodium diet for life this little container last me several months.

-1	B0013E21V8	ADN8MKY17P5HJ	Product packaged tightly but still leaked	The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto-shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.  Being opened enough to leak comprises quality, leaving it open to bacteria.	3	4

-1	B002T0IHPO	A1QB9DL94EXMUT	Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)	"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose."	30	8
1	B004OVATO8	A33J2VWP9HXDU9	A quality product with a few issues for me.	"These 1.5 oz fruit and nut bars have excellent taste.  I've never been much of a fan of other snack bars I've tried, but I can say that this was really quite impressive.  The first ingredient listed on the package is almonds and that flavor was very noticeable for me.  The peanuts also add a distinct taste.  (The picture on the wrapper shows cashews and walnuts, but they are not in the ingredient listing and I did not find them in the bar.)  The two types of nuts combined with the chia and sunflower seeds and agave fiber provide any ""crunch"" you might be expecting.  I could not specifically see or taste the blueberry and cranberry fruits, but they are definitely there.  The pomegranate seeds are very visible.  The flavors all meld very well.  There was just enough individual nut flavor and the fruit combination provided the sweetness.  I did notice that the second ingredient is brown rice syrup, but since the bar is not overly sweet I think most of the sweet flavor comes from the fruits.<br /><br />At 190 calories per bar this seems to be a snack you would want to keep track of to make sure you don't eat too many simply because they are so good, especially since 100 of those calories come from the fats.  I did find that the bar was rather sticky.  In fact, it has been quite a chore getting the bar separated from the wrapper so that I can eat it.  Then I'm left holding a sticky bar.  To counteract that you can simply hold the bottom of the bar by the wrapper as you eat it.  That brings me to one aspect of the bars which I'm not completely happy about.  Since the bar is sticky I chose to cut it into bite size pieces.  Anyone with any dental concerns at all will want to be careful when biting into this very dense, sticky bar.  And, if you are like me and have teeth set very close together, the seeds from the blueberries and cranberries can be a real challenge.  I find myself needing to use dental floss after eating each bar.  Hopefully that will not be an area of concern for you.<br /><br />If you've read this far you will have noticed the word ""sticky"" used quite often in my review.  That's because that was an issue for me and for my husband.  The taste is delicious.  The fact that most of the ingredients are organic is certainly a plus.  The vegan and gluten free aspects are going to be very valuable to some consumers.  Certainly I would say that this is a quality product."	0	1
1	B006N3I2SK	A33EZUHMRL9YWP	A way for a coffee drinker to enjoy decaf	I'm a coffee drinking fiend, but the caffeine ups and downs were really starting to wear on me.  I've been hesitant switching to decaf coffee becuase I thought I had to give-up the bold taste that I enjoy so much.  Green Mountain's Extra Bold decaf was the answer.  I still enjoy that bold coffee taste, but without the sluggish affects of the caffeine lull later.  It's a win-win!	2	0

-1	B008O3G2GG	A30UDDRL5GASLA	Dogs like it more than I like giving it to them.	My dogs love this.  But it's undeniably odd.  Basically, it's packaged like those old roller bottles of deodorant.  You hold the it in front of your dog's face and they lick the rollerball.<br /><br />One of my dogs wanted nothing to do with it, but my puppy (who'll lick anything) dove right in.  That lured the wary dog into trying it.  Now they both love it.<br /><br />Frankly, though, I suspect they'd prefer food.  And I certainly like tossing treats to my dogs for them to catch instead of standing there like a servant holding what looks like a bottle of deodorant as they lick it.<br /><br />Might be good for dogs on a diet, though. You can treat them with a bit of flavor without so many calories.	1	0
1	B004YV80O4	A1Z5BD3VS00LC6	Tasty Comfort Food	A pouch of Velveeta cheese sauce differentiates this dinner from the usual skillet dinner. Added after the meal is cooked, the sauce does make for a saucy and tasty dish.	2	1
-1	B002D4DY8G	A11T807LX2EF00	Not quite there for me....	I love chocolate truffles.  When I saw this coffee I thought I would be in for a treat.  It was merely okay.  Nothing special for me.  Has a caffeine kick and is smooth, but you need to remember it's chocolate truffle and then, perhaps, you get a hint of the taste.<br /><br />Not a bad brand, but I will not go out of my way to buy this.  You would be better off mixing chocolate syrup with your coffee.  Again, this is my personal opinion.  Others may find it more than okay.<br /><br />For my money, it's not worth it.	1	0

-1	B00016AU3K	A20GJ7VOQ2LLK5	Contains Stevia	This tea tastes pleasant for your first 2 or 3 sips. Then it starts tasting pretty foul. I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.<br /><br />It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it. I wish I could just take it out!	0	2

-1	B0030VJ97Q	A15NS4T5L6CF5J	Recipe changed with no warning - packaging pictured is out of date	My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.	0	0

Yeah, they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that, as it turns out, is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special, in fact, that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates, like at bedtime, or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates, waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them, then I love them.  :)	1	0

1	B003P9XG72	A9364HO1WBU24	Picky Eater Likes It	Switched my 11 year old St. Bernard/Shiloh Shepherd mix from Eukanuba Senior to this after reading poor reviews about the nutritional value of the Eukanuba. Bane now looks for his food instead of being coaxed into eating it. Cats seem to like it too.	2	0
1	B000FIXT2I	A3J8DJZJ5QNI52	IT'S REAL GOOD!!!	I am a person who take good care of my health by eating good things. By now, I am very concerning what food should be included in our diets to maintain good health. Especially, high calories food based on carb make me worried about my diet. BUT! Since I tried this product, which is real good, I stop worrying to eat RICE. It's real low calories, healthy organic brown rice, not expensive, and easy to cook (just only 1min. 30sec. in the micro.). Anyway, I really enjoy this product, and of course buy again.	15	1
-1	B000KFXEWQ	A2M9ANEOKBVD2D	Surprise...bait and switch.	The company does not operate properly I ordered the French Vanilla.  That is the selection I clicked on and I recieved the White Chocolate. They should contact a buyer BEFORE shipping a substitution.	3	6
-1	B000Z91QJK	AB2DXTUIFAB3L	This stuff tastes horrible	I'm usually one to suck up my displeasure with the taste of new foods in the pursuit of health, but I had a truly difficult time getting and keeping this hemp seed butter down, and that was on a slice of sprouted bread with some peach butter smeared on top of it!! The taste is outrageously overpowering.<br /><br />I've vowed to finish my fairly small 10oz jar solely because I've paid for it. I honestly don't think I'll be buying this product again.<br /><br />Good luck my fellow health nuts...	3	0

My husband (who eats gluten) liked them much better than I did.<br /><br />I'll let all you 5-star folks have these; I'll have the Simplebites regular chocolate chip mini cookies, or the aforementioned dark chocolate chocolate chip cookies, thank you very much.	1	1

1	B001D0IZBM	A260U3KT12BCTP	the real bold coffee	I've chosen many bolds from the Amazon offers here as well as other on line shops. I always felt there left something more to be desired in each one I tried. This is the problem with the K-cup b/c the amount of coffee is limited, and when I am feeling like I want something stronger, which is often, I can't just put more in the hopper like I used to with the old machine. I often add another K cup after the first into teh same big cup. Also, often when I'd get to work I'd make another.<br /><br />I've had Emeril's Big Easy for a month now, and rarely have I felt like I needed to double the cups, or needed more when I get to work.<br /><br />I think that says it all.	1	0

1	B0030VJ70K	AILQOMSHD5K9Y	both kids love it!	"so my 1.5 year old eats this as a snack and my 3.5 year old daughter always sneaks in a few ""sips"". i long since stopped using a spoon to feed him out of these packs which is the MOST CONVENIENT thing! my kids just hold it and suck on the tip like a straw. whenever we go on a slew of errands i throw one into the diaper bag (nothing else needed) and feel better about giving him this as opposed to some kind of ""empty calorie"" cracker with GMOs. HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (green beans, pears, and peas) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with spinach you would think the color would be closer to a green rather than just pear/mango. i've made tons of baby food at home and anything with a good amount of spinach (since they place it first and list it first on the FRONT, but the ingredients show otherwise) turns green! i suppose they keep it to a small amount to avoid deterring kids by the color.<br />in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!"	2	0
-1	B001EO5U8I	A971V3U77BXE5	Looks good, tastes bad	I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea.	2	0

-1	B005GYYZTC	A2HLOKNGHKDVL0	A complete Abomination of my favorite Thai dish	"Having been given the opportunity to visit Thailand and frequenting the many Thai restaurants where I live I can honestly say I am spoiled when it comes to this dish. But now that I am in college and live in a dorm I picked this up at the local Lucky grocery and figured how bad could it be. Just look at the picture on the package. Sure it's missing sprouts and lemon and shrimp but it essentially looks like the dish it claims to be. Well one night after working out I was starving and decided to try this entree out. The minute I opened the package and saw the sauce i knew something was wrong. Like the previous reviewer stated, the sauce is nowhere close to being the flavor of Pad Thai. It looks like they just packaged some Hoisin sauce (which is popular to the Vietnamese when eating with Pho) but not Pad Thai!<br /><br />This is by far the worst microwave dinner ever conceived. As I write this I am looking at the packaging I notice in fine print ""PRODUCT of CHINA."" Well that explains everything. Why is a Thai dish being made by China?! On the other hand, I'd like to give the marketing team 5 stars for the excellent packaging that suckered me into buying this awful product. Thanks."	0	0
1	B0038B3AAK	A2BLKEF9FVG8IJ	Great Taste!	I honestly was scared of ordering this as some of the reviews are less than positive about the taste but seriously, it is good! If you are already a vegetarian or if veggies are a primary part of your daily diet you will have no problem with the taste, it's like eating sweet fresh grass. It is gritty but it doesn't bother me at all.	3	0
1	B003ETO4E2	A3C9J9PACZV2IZ	Great all-in-0ne batter	I found Lefty's Spices to be a good product for frying fish and chicken. It is a multi-purpose product<br />which can be used on a variety of meats. The taste is extraordinary and makes a beautiful brown crust<br />on fried meat. I found that heating the cooking oil (I used peanut oil) to 340 degrees was to hot for my<br />meats. At 340 degrees the coating browned beyond what I desired and burned. I reduced the heat to 225-250<br />degrees and obtained perfect results for my style of cooking. I did notice that it was better not to stir<br />or turn meat portions until the coating browned some (a minute or so) which prevented coating from falling<br />off meat. It is a good idea that you remove any flakes from your fryer between removal of finished meat and<br />the introduction of a new battered product. This will prevent build up in the bottom of the fryer which will<br />cause the flakes to burn and ruin your oil and meat.	0	0

Very bad diarhea that just got worse and worse until she we getting up in the night and had blood in her feces.  Since this has happened, I have heard about this happening to other dogs.  Too big a risk, the ingredients are right, but the result is extremely bad.	0	5
1	B0007A0AQM	A3UCHPLO3XEAXE	love the natural ingredients!	"I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE"">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market."	28	0

-1	B001BOQ3QY	A1U8LKRQ0MD1RT	Gave my lil guy bloody diarrhea!	"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!"	0	5
-1	B001EHEDLU	A3VK3ZLTMOUPAB	Bland & watery	I'm used to higher quality smoked salmon which is pink, a bit dry, yet slightly moist. The salmon packaged here was somewhat water-logged (considering 8oz, water is cheap, salmon is not), almost a grayish hue, and not very flavorful.

-1	B0014K91GY	A1G1XRJE50WOFB	Very weak flavor	I'm not happy at all with this cocoa. It's the weakest I've ever tasted. I add a little cream to help, and have given it a good try, but it's just NOT GOOD. I'm going back to Timothy's, which is far more flavorful. Additionally, I notice it seems to clog up my k-cup holder more than other cocoas I've tried. I generally don't leave bad reviews, but this was just plain NOT worth the money. The seller was very good however, I have no complaints in that regard. I just wouldn't buy this brand of cocoa again.	0	0

-1	B0002I0GXG	ANF1LPZ1W3Y75	Could not get firm stool with Wellness Just for Puppy	I had my Airedale Terrier puppy on Wellness Super Mix Just for Puppy from about 10 weeks to 14 weeks. During this time I had loose stools to no stools (i.e. the squirts). It was very frustrating. The ingredient list looks great and I was looking forward to feeding this kibble but it did not work out for my puppy. I switched her to my adult dog's kibble out of frustration and suddenly perfect poops. My adult eats Wellness Core orginal. I asked my vet if it would be ok to continue feeding the adult food to the 14 week puppy and she said it was fine.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy a small bag of Wellness Just for Puppy at first and if you don't get good stools then switch to something else immediately - don't wait around like I did. Not every food is going to work for every dog.	3	0
-1	B002N5IHSW	A15RT5XOD85Q29	Tea may taste good, but beware if drug testing	This tea  tastes fine, but if you have to have regular drug testing, as do many in my profession and others, this tea will definitely give a postive for cocaine metabolites, which coca leaves produce. Doesn't matter that the quantity is insignificant! For people who don't have to get regular drug testing,  enjoy the tea.

1	B001LO37PY	A22FJMS1DSOM6I	Oh, Lordy, YUM!!	This stuff is freaking delicious. I bought this juice on the colloquial advice that it's great for inflammation (I have gouty arthritis, which is awesome). It is so, so yummy, it's hard not to drink the entire container down with complete abandon to your inner glutton. I've also used it for flavoring muffins, corncakes and yogurt - ai-yo it's divine. My kids love it frozen with some vanilla soy milk for creamy, treaty goodness. And it is amazingly priced for SIX BOTTLES of 100% juice. Hundreds of uses, go crazy with your bad self.	21	1
-1	B0026RQTGE	A3P8WFZ3ZPA0AX	Find another treat	I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product. Your best friend deserves it.	0	4

(Of course, my food obsessed male cat could have eaten the whole can himself and then some). Upon opening the can, the food itself looked better than even ""people tuna"" with nice large chunks. The kitties' heads did not move from their bowls until every last morsel was gone. Nigel (foodie cat) kept looking around for more, checking out the kitchen, the table...<br /><br />The kitties certainly enjoyed it, but as their caretaker I also appreciated the ingredients. Fish and fish broth, and NO gluten or by products. Exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because of the price, I would probably consider this more as a treat or a meal supplement than a primary food. The serving suggestion is one can for each 2 1/2 pounds of body weight per day. Let's just say that for my two kitties, and Nigel Cat in particular, this would add up to a LOT of cans of food.<br /><br />However...I definitely plan to keep treating them!"	0	0

My cats will eat this up in a heart beat but I absolutely abhor the packaging.  Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.	2	0
1	B0090X8IPM	A265NE6H6LYX87	Rich Tasting!	Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee sounded so good, I decided to order it when it was offered through the Vine program. And I'm so glad I did! It has a full, rich flavor, which is surprising considering that it is definitely less aromatic than similar vanilla products. In fact, one has to lean in close even to a just opened bag to get a whiff of the vanilla (which for those of us who enjoy the smell of coffee, and particularly flavored coffee, is a disappointment). However, once brewed, the vanilla flavoring comes across in just the right amount. On the second brewing, we (my husband and I) did decide to make it a bit stronger just for personal tastes, but this coffee is smooth and full even without the extra boost. Definitely a coffee we'd both recommend to lovers of flavored coffees!	4	1

I was concerned that the so called K-Cup dark roasts would be weak and tasteless. I was wrong, in fact the Jet Fuel is a bit over the top dark and very acidic. I would recommend Emril's Big Easy Bold or a Coffee People French Roast for everyday - Jet Fuel is good for an occasional jolt.	0	0

The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there were other flavors, like maybe lemonade, cherry, etc.  I think the strawberry bananna is ok except that I don't like banannas so I mix a little lemon with it and that takes the bananna flavor away.

I sent an email to the manufacturer but did not receive a straight answer.  Their reply is that all their oils are pressed by expeller-presser at room temperature without using any chemicals.

As I remember the patties came in a plastic wrapper much like a loaf of bread/bagles and contianed about 12 pieces. I believe the wrapper had the colors of the Italian flag, red, white and green, and/or maybe even had a small Italian flag on the wrapper.

I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.

-1	B0027Z8VES	A1DTNTNTNA1TSG	The office coffee club consensus	My office has a coffee club where everyone chips in and we buy coffee to try from all over. We ordered Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark to give it a try.<br /><br />This coffee is roasted very dark roast without being burnt. Those of us in the office who like our coffee on the strong side really enjoyed the blend. It is a blend, I would assume of Sumatran and Costa Rican beans. The roast was actually too strong for the coffee drinkers who like light to medium roasts so we will not be purchasing this one again.<br /><br />I took a little of this home and tried it in the Moka pot. I personally like dark roasts and this was too strong for me when using the espresso esk method.<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars because it's not for everyone. I feel the blend could have been a little better (use of cheaper Central American beans) at he $11 plus per pound reduced amazon price.	11	3

Two of the three, would turn their faces away refusing to take the biscuit in their mouth or even lick it.  The third dog would readily eat them but she also has a nasty habit of eating dead animals and squirrel poop.  After giving my single ""test subject"" 2 biscuits a day for 2 weeks I did not notice any reduction in the visible tarter on her teeth nor did I notice fresher breath.

I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products.  Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires.  Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them:  Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva.

-1	B004MO6NI8	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	Do We Really Need Another Energy Drink or Any Energy Drinks at All?	"I have drunk energy drinks in the past, though they were coffee flavored rather than fruit flavored.  They seemed to help wake me up in the morning and give me enough of an energy boost to help me kick off my day.  I usually substituted these drinks for breakfast, so the calories were not an issue.  I was unsure of what this energy drink would do for, or to me.<br /><br />Initially, I was unable to identify the flavor.  I kept sipping to try to figure it out.  The next thing I knew, the drink was gone.  It was about that time that I figured out the flavor was grapefruit.  Before I go on, be aware that there are less expensive ways of getting a grapefruit flavored drink.  For example, you could drink Ocean Spray's grapefruit drinks, which include several varieties.  Crystal Light also makes a grapefruit drink.  Lots of options exist that do not contain the caffeine of this energy supplement.  Of course, where is the fun in that?<br /><br />I drank the whole, 230-calorie can.  Of course, that is supposed to be two servings.  Did I feel more energetic?  Actually, no.  I felt a bit light-headed rather than energetic.  I even felt a little sleepy, perhaps because of all the calories.  All that caffeine also seemed to require a number of trips to the restroom, and my mouth felt dry.  I guess there is more evidence that caffeine is a diuretic.<br /><br />Do we really need yet another energy drink?  I wonder whether some of the ""energy"" effect is related to the belief that an energy drink will wake you up.  This drink did not seem to give me more energy.  Just the opposite, it made me feel tired.  The flavor was okay, but there are less expensive ways to drink a grapefruit flavored drink.  Maybe an easier way to get energy is to get plenty of rest and to get some exercise.  Something to consider.<br /><br />Good luck!"	0	3

1	B002PI82P0	ADLZRP567PR7R	Great Cup. Form Follows Function.	We bought an Incanto Sirius at twice the price. It looked Marvelous with it's stainless and digital exterior. It cleaned it's self and did interesting tricks with the display. Then on the third day it went bizerk and consumed a full hopper of Lavazza Oro without delivering a single cup of coffee. The seizure was fatal and the machine could not deliver another cup. Oh did it hurt being coffeeless after those three days of pleasure with the cost of a short vacation.<br /><br />Returning the Incanto Sirius to the store, I came home with the Viena Plus. It is a little plasticy looking and the tray does not click into place the way the Incanto did. There is a blinking green light to indicate that the machine is warming instead of an LCD temperature indicator. There is only one boiler that has to be shared for seam and brewing. It is somewhat Spartan in fact.<br /><br />The coffee brewed by the Viena Plus is excellent. The crema is thick and rich. Frothed milk climbs vertically out of the cup. The dreggs pucks are firm and lightly moist. There is no leaking and very little spillage from the brew group which is easy to remove and clean. This machine might not be the expensive, flashy, big show, high maintenance beauty queen, but it does deliver at about half the price.	4	0

-1	B000FFIL92	A3C91ILOQ8ONYT	Very pretty.	What is so great about these teas is the novelty. They are beautiful to watch flower, which has a very calming effect, which is something I enjoy about tea in general. So the beautiful appearance is a bonus in that area. However, these are not the best tasting teas I've tried and I love Numi teas. They are not bad, they are worthwhile soft flavors, but if I were buying simply on taste I probably would not purchase Numi flowering teas again. Also, the actual glass teapot is very small, maybe makes enough for two people at the most. The box the flowering teas are sent is reusable, but poorly constructed. Not really worth keeping if that sort of thing matters to you. In short I would buy again, but mostly for aesthetic reasons.	0	0
1	B000MTA1EY	A28G6QAQG17UHU	Does the job as far as frosting goes...	I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday.  The cake did indeed look black after mixing this coloring with the chocolate frosting, so I'd say it works.  It will also color your tongue bluish but that's just par for the course.  My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success.	1	0
-1	B0018CFQLC	A1PMIPL211O2B3	Cats loved the old flavor, hate the new	"As another poster mentioned, Nature's Variety decided to change their formula for their Rabbit food.  I had finally found a rabbit diet that my sensitive stomach kitty enjoyed, however when I got my most recent shipment (I was on amazon's auto-refill), I was surprised to find the kernels were smaller.  This led me to do some online research and I discovered that they decided to mess with their ingredients.  I don't know how pork could possibly give this food a ""better flavor"" than before, but my cats HATE this food.  I have one cat that will eat pretty much anything, except this apparently.  Now I have a $40/12lb bag of food that neither cat will eat.<br /><br />As expensive as this diet is, I had expected better from Nature's Variety and I am sad to say I canceled my auto-refill subscription and now have to find a new diet.  I can't believe that a company that prides themselves on producing a diet similar to what cats would eat in the wild would add pork flavor to their food.  I can see a wild cat eating rabbit, but not a pig!  Also, it would have been nice to see this new formula advertised on their bag of food - I had to find out on my own that they had been messing around.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is awesome.  I inquired about returning the food, and although they do not take returns on grocery items, they did refund the full amount.  I wasn't expecting a refund, but was very pleased with their customer service, this is why I will continue to do most of my shopping on Amazon.com!<br /><br />I have now tried the Instinct Chicken flavor and, while both cats do enjoy this food, I am still wishing I had an alternative protein source (i.e. rabbit or venison) in case the sensitivity was actually an allergy to chicken (I'm hoping it's just an allergy to grains, as this is pretty common)."	3	0

1	B001TM3XF2	A302WAL30PE9MO	My pup's favorite brand of canned food	My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.	0	0

It has potato, tomato, peas, blueberries and raspberries in it, none of which are a part of a dog's natural diet. Canines of all kinds get all the nutrition required in the wild just from eating meat.  Anything else is just filler.	1	42

I even tried stuffing real p-nut butter in other bones, but my 2 bichons could tell the difference. Like the first reviewer, my dogs are crazy about these little bones. It's no use trying to give them something else. Only these will do. Once they suck all the p-nut butter off, they want a new bone. So, they are limited to one per day.  Great little product.	3	0
-1	B0081XPTBS	ANK079EWCOSV	Product great, shipping problems	The formula is great.  Our babies like it, it's organic, and the can isn't lined with plastic, so there's less chance of it containing BPA.  Now, although the product is great, we've had problems with Amazon shipping it to us.  They put 8 cans in an oversize box without enough padding so they were moving around and banging into each other.  Of the 8 cans, 6 were dented.  Of the 6 dented cans 3 had opened, exposing the formula to air and spilling some out.  We've ordered this from another online retailer before and the packaging was great.  Four cans to a box and 2 boxes to a larger shipping box.  Amazon is a bit cheaper and they have the subscription service which makes it convenient, but that's only if you don't have to deal with several cans in each shipment being unusable.  If they can improve the shipping, we highly recommend this product, especially the subscription service.	3	4

-1	B001TM70V0	A370LOV1VHBQDA	Less is not More	I recently changed over from dry to wet food for my cats.  Trying to find a grain, veggie and fruit free food is not easy, cats are obligate carnivores remember and don't need that stuff (do the research).  I thought I found it in this chicken product.  However, when I opened the can I noticed lots of fluid and potato starch. After spilling out the liquid and rinsing off the potato starch (why is that there anyway? A filler?) The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same. I just want the company to know if they say its 5.5 oz. then don't pump it up with junk to save a few pennies.  Consumers are not stupid.	7	2

The description should have said that they will not work in all models, but there was no mention of this.<br /><br />I had been using the foil method and had been waiting for these to come back in stock and the price to go below $10 for 3 (I really only needed one but could only find packs of 3 or more, which gives me 2 spares which I guess is OK since the cat would be sure to play hockey with one and lose it under the stove). So finally I order and eagerly await these, only to be disappointed and have to return them and order something else.<br /><br />Have decided to try instead the DisposaCup Lids which are more expensive, but appear to allow for the machine to punch a hole where it wants to.	0	0

In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them.	3	0

Do not let the pictures deceive you, the pods work perfectly in my Keurig B60 machine.<br />2.  It's comparable to the Newmans Own Extra Bold organic with less intense bitterness. If you like your coffee strong and bitter this may not be for you.<br />3.  The packaging is fine. It comes in vacuumed sealed bags. The pods are hard topped with a tea bag type of material bowl bottom that will allow the coffee to steep when the water is injected into the pod. This design leaves the coffee vulnerable to air and dust if not stored properly.  It's an easy fix. I just toss them into a ziplock bag when I open a vacuum sealed pack of pods. Not a big deal.<br />4.  It seems like the pod design is why the coffee comes out so well.

-1	B0002ASNAW	AVD8M9QQ60JF4	Not worth the cost for the amount of time they last. Plus, possible safety hazard to the dog.	"I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a ""moderate"" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of ""give,"" and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog's digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a ""grain of rice""--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a ""powerful"" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company's liability, but they are right."	0	0

-1	B001BORBM4	A2VF25F0XZHXMW	Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein	I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine.	0	0

1	B0015XX01W	A343Y76WJTBYP6	memory lane	I bought these as a goof as they reminded me of when I was a kid and whenever I give one to a friend it starts a whole conversation about when we were growing up and you would buy them in a candy store and we just laugh about the old days.  Only problem I found is many of the packages are filled with green and purple my two least favorite flavors but aside from that also that they are packaged individually in the summer is great I keep a package with me all the time	0	0

-1	B0060KPEK0	A3Q7X3FU12UVS6	Awful	I thought it tasted terrible...not the usual Liptons. My previous purchase of Lipton's unsweetened was not decaf, and it was excellent, so I don't know if this tasted bad to me because it is decafeinated, or because it contained maltodextrin in the ingredients (it wasn't pure tea).  Anyway, I am going to try Nestea next.	0	0

I would go with what Kraft makes because believe us, adding water to it is well well well worth the effort after tasting this stuff.	0	1

-1	B002WDCBZU	A6XQPTJEHVKXC	keep looking	I purchased the Tassimo machine because it had good reviews and the coffee I had tasted from the Keurig of friends was not to my liking. It tasted very much like the coffee you get from the ubiquitous coffee machines in factory break rooms. Tassimo no longer carries Starbuck's coffee, and it looks as if Gevalia will be its replacement. Not a good choice. I bought the coffee from Amazon because the Tassimo disks are very rare in stores around my area. What taste there is in Gevalia is only a little bit better than the coffee machine dispensers at airports. Perhaps the fault is with Tassimo, which doesn't deliver coffee that is hot enough?	0	0

1	B0049YK1FC	A2E5C8TTAED4CQ	Good Clean Barley	Not much to say here.  The barley is as advertised.  The shipping was slower than I expected, especially since the state of origin isn't all that far from my home, but the price was better than I could find anywhere else.<br /><br />This is hulled barley, which has the bran intact, unlike pearl barley.  It takes longer to cook, but it also keeps better and that is what I want in a grain.  Also, of course, having the bran intact means having the bran to eat, which is more fiber in our diets.  I have cooked this whole in a stew, and it was the same as pearl barley in appearance.  I cracked it in a Corona mill and it then cooked up like rice in a soup.<br /><br />When we poured it into the storage bucket, the grain appeared clean.  There was no dirt or foreign plant material.	15	0
1	B0045XE32E	A2JR5MYW7Q4XGN	My dogs loved it!	It's hard to review a dog treat past whether or not your dogs ate the one you gave them and then wanted more!  Mind did.  They were happy to have the treat and even happier when they got another one later.  Of course, my dogs are good eaters and one of them, which I rescued from the street when she was about 6 months old and was malnourished, is loathe to ever turn down some food.  (I guess they never forget what it was like to be hungry...)<br /><br />What more can you say?  They were a hit!	0	0
-1	B00444ZASU	A1NZ8PF1WX4LOS	+Too finely chopped	Was disappointed in this product. The olives are so finely chopped that they look like medium size ground coffee.

1	B001VNGG58	A10DRHWKS6NQUX	Spicy!	This cayenne pepper is GREAT!  This has real spice to it.  All the other cayenne peppers I've used have had sort of a dirty flavor with not much heat, but this one is clean and HOT.  You only have to use a little bit to get that kick in your food.  Which makes it great for seasoning and very economical.  I recommend this to anyone.	6	0

1	B000PDY3P0	A2014JCB1ZFW0H	Easy way to make popcorn	About a year ago, I purchased a 6 oz popcorn machine for my business in order to give my customers some free snacks while they are in my store.  I purchased these 6 oz popcorn packs and love them.  I do not have to worry about portions or measuring.  Everything comes in a handy serving pack with the correct mixture.  Super easy!

-1	B000ED7M3Q	A194ZPEEAAUGOU	Not as good as Pamela's or Bisquick	"After reading the first few chapters of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1609611543"">Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health</a> and after years of joint inflammation (and now difficulty losing weight), I decided to ditch wheat from my diet. Being desperate to get started, I picked up a bag of this flour at a local store as it was the only one available. My husband and I like our pizzas on Saturday night and since the frozen aisle didn't have anything good in gluten free, I decided to make my own crust. As some reviewers said, the bean flavor really ruined the taste! The pizza crust actually came out well and is one of the best I've ever made with any flour texturewise. But I just didn't like the flavor. I plan to use up the rest in another pizza, but this time will add spices like garlic and oregano plus a little more salt and sugar to the crust itself to mask that taste. My advice would be to get Pamela's or Bisquick gluten-free. Both are good and don't have weird aftertastes."	0	0
1	B000EMM9AS	A3BH49ZKESHDID	A quick side dish	This is another quick to prepare product that can be used either as a light lunch, or as a rice side dish.  Following directions, I cooked it for 4 1/2 minutes and ended up with a slightly moist rice (directions incluce letting it stand for a couple minutes after cooking).  It has a very pronounced herbal flavor.  It is a bit high on sodium with 780 mg.  It is listed as 250 calories.	1	0

1	B001BOVE54	A3OHADG98OLCAB	Definitely healthy, just maybe not the most tasty	My cat who I got since 2009 when she was 2 months old had been eating this since 2010.  Her coat is so shinny and soft and had never had any health problem.  Maybe she's just a tough cat but I think I can attribute a lot of credits to this food.<br /><br />As I do a mix of wet/dry food, she prefers the wet (of course) but will eat these.  I don't have to put too much out at a time since it seems to last.  Either she doesn't like the food that much and/or it's a proper amount of food for her to eat because she's eating only when she's hungry.  I'm ok either way because it keeps her healthy :)<br /><br />Like the other review said, sometimes you may get a package where a lot of the nuggets turned into powder.  Hence the one star off.	0	0

Devotees of all-natural foods might be attracted by the lack of GMO ingredients, artificial colors/flavors, preservatives, etc. - that's not a selling point for me, though.  At my age I need all the preservatives I can get!	0	0

-1	B000WFMCFE	A39GSBHR6509MV	Great Value, A Little Broken Up	I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.	3	2

1	B001E5E29A	APZ25VUSNDATB	Best waffle mix ever!	This is my favorite waffle mix (it can be used to make pancakes too, but you have to add milk, and we don't usually have milk in the house).  You have to add water, 1 egg, and melted butter for the waffle recipe.  We eat waffles about once a week.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake/waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.<br /><br />We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.<br /><br />The can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter.<br /><br />We just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next.	0	0
-1	B005CP1WZ0	A2FIC3VZ1JYN3N	TOO MANY BROKEN PRETZELS	I ordered these pretzels for a party that I was going to have. When I opened the box, to my dismay, about one third of the pretzels were broken to the point of being large crumbs. I didn't have time to send them back before my party, so I picked out what I could that was presentable. We have since gone to Costco to restock. Not only were the pretzels whole, the price was half. Sounds like a much better deal to me.....	4	1

That being said, I am considering ordering a case for my next cult suicide.  (Yes, Next) Now, on the subject of ""Enjoy the Dark Side"" I find that even comparing the god awful taste of this water to something as mild as the sith (compared to the water of course) is just insulting. Also, on the subject of my grammar that last sentance, it's possibly a side effect of the water's terribly written website, and the chemicals from all of the decaying plant matter that makes up 90% of the bottle.

Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.	17	20

-1	B000E63L6U	A2SCW8P8HFJFKU	this is not the old Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger!	I was so excited to find my old favorite tea on amazon. I have been looking for it in supermarkets for months, but thought it had been discontinued. However I wish I had listened to the earlier review. This is not the same formula as it was, the peppermint overpowers all the other flavors in this tea. It used to have a citrusy flavor, tangy and lovely, now all you can smell or taste is peppermint and I don't like peppermint tea.	11	0
1	B000E1BLS0	A26M4FOUBQWG4B	Yummy Cheesecake Dessert	This is great for a quick, easy, versatile dessert when you don't want to heat up the oven. Although it doesn't taste exactly like cheesecake, it's a pretty good cheesecake-like dessert for the price. I like to make the mini-cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit. One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store.	5	1
-1	B000LR0M00	A34VXECAE6K2PS	Tasted a little off	It may have been just the one we had, but it tasted bitter. I'm hoping it was just that caviar and not that it was spoiled. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't worth it.	2	0
1	B001EO7NJM	AKJ7R0TLW7PRC	Best Tasty Cashews	I ordered these directly from Sunflower Food & Spice Company when I ordered their Honey Toasted Sunflower Nuts.

The sunflower nuts are delicious too. Highly recommend.	1	0
1	B001Q9EFW8	A2OZ6PW2W5FQTP	My dogs really liked them	My dogs started eating these the minute I gave them to them, and they seemed to last a little longer than other biscuits I've bought for them.  I can't say if these biscuits really will cut down on the amount of tarter on their teeth just yet, but I'm sure time will tell.  For now I see no harm in giving them the 2 two biscuits each day that the box recommends, and hopefully it will help cut down on the tarter.  That they really liked them was an added bonus.	1	0

1	B000E23VXW	A1KIOAZRIQFWEH	Taste, Mixability Poor, Nutrition Optimum	"This powder tastes very earthy (think vegetable fibers and peat) frankly.  If you're consuming this, you're probably not particularly interested in drinking a milkshake (If you are, go to the Mickey Dees and grab a big ol' glass of milk and assorted toxins).  This is not a product that is meant to ""taste like candy"", so if you are used to those designer whey powders that are full of sucralose and/or other artificial toxins and ridiculous flavors like  ""Super Duper Berry Cookie Crunch"", then you will find this product to be very disappointing.<br /><br />This product has very low solubility in water or milk, but mixes better with any freshly squeezed (non-factory-processed juices).  Fresh squeezed juice will generally have pith, fiber, etc. left in it that adds to its viscosity and greatly lowers the rate of dissolution (how long it takes for the hemp to become 'unmixed' and sink to the bottom of the glass).  Essentially, the thicker the solvent, the less that the hemp will settle.  Additionally, having the juice at room temperature will further increase the solubility.<br /><br />I might also suggest a shaker/bottle combination of some type, as opposed to an open glass stirred with a spoon.  I use a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018G4ZEW"">BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blue</a> myself.<br /><br />If you want a cheaper way to mix up milled hemp, please note that the above rules are applicable to canned tomato juice, since it is viscous, and stores well at room temperature (and is dirt cheap).  Most of the time I take my hemp protein with a can of no-salt-added tomato juice (it is delicious and so easy to make for a low-carbohydrate, high-protein breakfast.<br /><br />This product is pure and truly free of chemicals, there is only one ingredient:  Cold-milled hemp protein, mechanically pressed (no reverse osmosis or other chemical processes are used on the hemp seeds).  The reason that people consume this is for maximum nutrition.  All you get is Protein, antioxidants, heart-healthy fatty-acids, and a little fiber (from the hulls), that is everything nutritionally in this stuff.  It is awesome."	12	1
1	B000HDL1RQ	AQFTBJZPVNMAH	Tasty & Addictive	"It is a very tasty treat I enjoy with my afternoon coffee. However, all good things must be had in moderation, and hence I will only buy one pack at a time from the local store.<br />However the price on Amazon is competitive.<br /><br />I don't know why it was tagged as ""not vegetarian"" because I don't see any questionable ingredient on the list - perhaps someone else can elaborate.<br /><br />The dark chocolate filling has a nice creamy texture without being overwhelming; and nor is it cloyingly sweet.<br /><br />Overall all, I definitely recommend this product."	7	0
-1	B001EQ4KJ6	A1AVMD1015KNX5	Nowhere near Haribo	Sorry, but it does not pass my taste test. I've always liked the Haribo brand gummies, but the Albanese brand just does not cut it.

-1	B000I1OLT2	A1AEQZM99LO9VA	OK Tea, not bad	I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas.	1	0

However, this version of the candy does not have the same kick.  The fizz is hardly noticeable.  Unless my tongue sensitivity has changed, I don't think this is the same as the original, or at least not the way I remember zots to be when I was a kid buying these from a corner store.  It brings back good memories, but a little disappointing as I expected it to be exactly the same as the original.	1	0

1	B006DQZ064	A7598PSGCRS4C	Real espresso taste	I purchased the Ethical Coffee Capsules this week to try on my Nespresso Lattissima that I purchased from Sur La Table-which did not sell Nespresso capsules-Strange.<br />I picked the ECC Espressivo for its strong intensity rating as I like a strong espresso.  I popped the first capsule into the machine and pulled down the lever and heard the pop of the capsule and soon smelled a very pleasant aroma that immediately reminded me of the Italian coffee shops of Milan.  THe Espressivo had a very strong taste and a smooth finish and gave me just the right lift I was looking for.  I then had a latte the next day and the combination of milk & crema was perfect- I am sold.  The convenience of getting the capsules delivered right to our door (free of charge) is brilliant along with the whole biodegradable capsule which my wife said she would put into our garden is a nice feeling.  I have already ordered the other flavors.<br /><br />Coffee guy!	2	1

-1	B0027Z8VES	A34O50KWHTRXK3	Average	I agree with some reviewers about the oiliness of the beans. They never specified if the beans were arabica or robusta, but judging from the appearance, smell, taste, caffeine content and amount of crema obtained, I think that there is a high percentage of robusta in this. That being the case, I would have been better off roasting my local beans myself, because the results are almost the same for a fraction of the price. Just came from finishing off a 2.2 lb of Lavazza and I was a bit disappointed with the taste of the Kicking Horse to be honest. Maybe other tasters have different preferences, so to each his own, but I'll stick to what I'm comfortable with.	0	0

1	B000FBQ594	A1SI2993YY7C61	a big no-no for Amazon	This a  great cookie. It's been a favorite since the first day I tried it at an IKEA in NJ. I bought a box of them. Then I bought 2 more boxes!<br /><br />So why only 4 stars? There's a reason I got them for as little as I did. They're from 2003. I bought them in 2006. That's not something I expected from Amazon. And a lot of the cookies came broken from rough handling. So I knocked off a star. Still tasted great. And I'm still alive.	3	0
1	B004391DK0	AVIWM0DNQU6KJ	Just needs larger boxes	I've been gluten free for 12 years now, have tried many bread mixes, and I love this one.  So does my husband, who is not gluten free.  I hope that everyone supports these Bisquick products, since big brand gluten-free bread and pasta products are so rare, and so rarely good.  It was something special for me when these came out (if you can imagine waiting a decade for this, you'll understand).  If those of us with celiac disease/gluten-intolerance keep enjoying them, maybe the price will come down (though it's not bad now) and they will offer bulk deals.  It will also wake up other manufacturers.  I would happily order a case or much larger package.  I can make my own bread, but I prefer to use a mix, and use my cooking time for main dishes.  So don't hesitate to try it, I can't imagine being disappointed by this product.  However, I do find it for less at my local grocery store.	1	0
-1	B000FFLXOC	A3BZRWP87BQG7J	Not a good idea to order in bulk	Out of the 6 loaves, I ended up throwing 4 of them away as they were molded.

1	B001EO616S	A1WXJ1I42UOQ2V	A Great Breakfast Honey	This Ambrosia honey has a mild spicy sweet taste that reminds me of cinnamon sugar.  I've tried it with hot biscuits and butter and think it would be great in oatmeal or with french toast.  A perfect compliment to the breakfast table and the price is incredible (cheaper than the local honey's available) along with being an American made product.	23	1
-1	B007RQVQN0	A2RQ2MVF8RTH4I	Slightly disappointing	I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. It does a good job of sweetening, but I had been using a brown sugar substitute that is no longer made. It had had a genuine natural brown sugar flavor. This is just a bit different. Nevertheless, I plan to use it on my hot cereal, which is when I use it, not for baking.	0	0
-1	B000P54HVS	A35LT14WG5BX0T	Just okay	For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.	0	0
-1	B001LGGH40	AHRNDSKWH1YBT	WHOO WEE That is a Sweet Drink!!	Don't get me wrong, it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so.

1	B000084E6V	A19MVNNI6ZEV0B	Perfect Chew	I'd been eying the Nylabone Dental Dinos in our local pet store for awhile but put off purchasing one for our four month old sheltie figuring it'd be too hard or too heavy for him at such a young age... but then we revived one from my mother (non-dog owner) as a gift for the puppy and he loves it!  It's his favorite chew after the Nylabone Edibles (he's a little glutton) and he can spend hours chewing on it from all angles.<br /><br />He wasn't so keen on it to start out with, but a little playing (hold it out and then pull it back- not mean just to get him to chase it) has turned it into one of his favorite toys.  It's durable, easy to clean and the shape is quite engaging.  He can manipulate it, chew on the various limbs and carry it all around the house.	0	0

1	B001M09BTS	A21SRC1FU0ESOD	I wonder how long it will be available?	I like this product a lot, particularly the fact that it uses natural sweeteners. But, how long will it be around? My local grocer quit carrying it, and the official Quaker website doesn't list the weight control version. So I'm guessing it'll only be around while supplies last. I switched to Old Fashioned Oats and simulate the maple and brown sugar flavor by adding maple extract and molasses. But that gets tedious, (and maple extract is pricey) especially after work when I'm tired but want a good bowl of oatmeal.	0	3

-1	B004U49QU2	A188JOXWF4EY1R	Not Bad, But Not Great	"We tend to be homemade cookie fans around our house. But, for those times when we do pick up a package of store bought, Chips Ahoy's regular chewy chocolate chip cookies are usually among the top choices. So I thought these would be worth a try. They are good - nothing phenomenal or fantastically exciting, though. I will say that I don't think Chips Ahoy did as well with the chocolate cookie as they do with regular chewy chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />What I expected: A moist, chewy cookie with a slightly runny, ""gooey"" center. Essentially, I expected something like the picture on the package.<br /><br />What I found: A slightly less moist than expected cookie with a center that was more like fudge - not hard, but also not gooey.<br /><br />Bottom line: The kids definitely thought they were good, even my spoiled ""homemade cookie only"" son. Because they were not gooey, they also weren't very messy. That makes serving one to busy kids does not result in chocolate everywhere! I did like that. I doubt these will make it to the ""top choices"" category, but we enjoyed the package we tried."	0	0

I ordered 2 cans.  It arrived on time.  I followed direction to prepare a cup of chocolate.  The powder was very hard to dissolve.  After I worked on it using an electric mixer (since manual mixing failed, I thought to myself that is great, I can do that, no problem.  Time to taste the drink.  It tasted horrible.  The sweetness is artificial and chemical.  So I turned to the label to read ingredients.  Far from being all natural.  I dumped the drink in the sink and I was amazed that all the protein was at the bottom of the cup.  I went on line to return the product.  I was shocked to find out it was not returnable.

1	B007R1PGVS	A1WBZVB0BQMMJB	"To give a ""real"" review"	"Since people can't seem to figure out that the reviews are for the products and not the companies delivering them, I've decided to write a review exclusively FOR THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure.  Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12.  The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters.  I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed.  I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym.  The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks.  And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously.<br /><br />The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water.  You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy!  If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess!  I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg).  It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys.  With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg ""proprietary"" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root.  I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda.  The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink."	12	1

1	B001CGTN1I	A3N7PXM9QB59HL	Delicious, Nutritious,  and a Great Buy!	I am in Chia heaven. I have been wanting to try Chia since reading about its versatility and health benefits but I waited, put off by the steep, in-market, price tag.  Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds, purchased via Amazon, are half the price of the in-store product.  I was worried about how long it would take for them to arrive and also about how fresh they would be since seeds can spoil and become rancid.  The product arrived promplty, within 2 mailing days and was fresh and delicious.  I have since been using it in smoothies in place of flax seed,  and creating very nutritious desert blends. They have a texture similar to tapioca ( but smaller) when mixed with liquid. I am a fan and would encourage you if you are interested in supplementing your diet with  Chia seeds to look up recipes on line and experiment. Do your pocket book a favor though, and skip the super market, or health food store for Chia Seeds.  The mark-up is high.  Purchase Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds online.	1	0
-1	B008RWUHA6	A1SCANWWQTEG9I	Acquired taste?	Normally I love granola but....<br />I tried this straight out of the bag, sprinkled on yogurt and in a bowl of milk and in every variation it just tasted stale to me. I don't know if that's the flavor from the flax seed or what but it was not appealing. I also pawned some off on my kids to try and they didn't care for it either. I would have to say it is better with something than alone (both to mask it's taste and because it is very crumbly)<br /><br />On the plus side it seems very healthy... perhaps by the time I finish the bag I will have acquired a taste for it.	0	1

Otherwise its a nice oil and I can buy it at the local Martians grocery store. I can't eat it alone and even in my morning oatmeal its still to much. If you love an over powering taste and smell of coconut you will probably love this product if you don't then pass on this one.	9	11

1	B0002EOW4E	A2FQMQVLDKS538	great, nasty stuff	This product is visually nauseating and smells horrible.  My dogs absolutely love it and it is great for them.

It took forever to be shipped, though.  Waiting a full weekf or your coffee is not convenient.

-1	B0083T5TAQ	A3C5YHTV72WYJY	Not a nice assortment	"I have wanted to try flavored coffee but didn't want to take the chance of buying a whole box and not likely the flavor. This was a good solution. I read the few reviews and took chance. Well I'm a little dissapointed. Most of the box expires by December which isn't to big of deal because I'll have them gone by then, but the assortment sucked. At least a third of them were the same flavor from the same maker. When you add that to the number of ""french vanilla"" ones that I got it's at least 2/3 of the box. I wanted an assortment, not mostly french vanilla made by a few different companies. I think I have 5 or 6 that weren't french vanilla. Oh and top it off, those 5 or 6 are the only different brands too. The rest of the box is Van Houtte coffee."	144	5
1	B003OZX4ME	A10UT56NN3W8XJ	my favorite	This is my favorite cold drink. It is light and refreshing and satisfies my craving for carbonation but with big flavor that you don't normally find in flavored waters. It is also very low in calories but has enough body so it doesn't taste thin like many diet drinks. I love the fact I can have it delivered every month, it is very hard to find elsewhere.

-1	B000J2DQJQ	A2S7Y38ACMP7U2	Mushy like oatmeal!	After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to getting these.  The arrived and I excitedly opened a can.  The texture was soft and the fish fell apart at the slightest touch. I could barely pick it up with a fork as it broke into a million little mushy pieces every time I touched it.  I thought it must be a fluke- an odd can that was abnormal.  Every can I have opened is the same.  The flavor is fine but the texture is totally off-putting.  I'll not buy any more.<br /><br />B. G.

1	B00141SPNI	A31YSTICHFYN7O	Healthy treats that help to naturally calm excited dogs	"We originally bought this brand due to the claim that it uses ""All Natural Cage Free Chickens"" as well as the ""No Hormones"" and ""No Antibiotics,"" etc.  But the items were surprisingly better in quality than the package claimed.  These strips are real strips of dried chicken, not just processed ""meats"" as some companies may use.  This particular flavor became our household favorite due to the effect it has on our easliy excited black lab, Hayden.<br /><br />At first I thought the ingredients were just light flavoring, since all of the packages seem to contain the exact same looking treats.  But, the smell is very strong.  This flavor contains chamomile and lavender - which claims to calm your dog.  This claim is very true for our dog.  Only after a couple of nights, we noticed a considerable difference in behavior for Hayden.  Our dog usually gets wound up in the evening time and continually wants to play even right before we go to bed.  After giving Hayden six strips, which is the suggested amount for his body size, he became docile and even sleepy before our bed time.<br /><br />I usually don't believe the statements that most products like this claim, but I can say we have noticed a big difference.  Granted the effect is short term and can't be predicted for really young dogs or ""unfixed"" dogs (for comparison our dog Hayden weighs 85 lbs, is 6 years old, and has been fixed).<br /><br />These are the draw backs though.  1) This is an expensive way to treat large dogs EVERY DAY, so maybe not realistic for everyone.  2) The effects may only last a few hours, so overly exciteable dogs may be able to ""battle through"" the effects.  3) Flavor is very strong and very odd (lavender?) some pickier dogs could turn their noses up to the smell and flavor of these treats.<br /><br />Just a note - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IUZZ2"">Dogswell Happy Heart Chicken Breast, Flax Seed & Taurine, 3-Count 16-Ounce Bags</a> seems to have the opposite effect on our dog.  This product contains taurine - like Redbull - so maybe that's the reason.  I'd recommend that Happy Heart flavored treats should be avoided late in the evening."	12	0
1	B002QWP89S	A1HX8QTL1Z2ZF3	Good price.	I buy these locally, and they are more expensive than Amazon.com.<br />My dog likes them and we do see a difference in her teeth.<br />Thanks.	0	0
-1	B001KQAR24	A3PID7HMOGX7YW	Wound up at the ER	I won't go all the way to 1-star since this is probably more about me and not the foodstuff but, despite the claim that hemp seeds are not known to contain allergens, I did experience *some kind* of reaction to 4 tbsp of this stuff this past Monday, about 4 hours after ingesting it. I passed out, was shaking uncontrollably when I came to, felt tingling followed by a loss of sensation, nausea, pain, and shortness of breath. I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did.	2	4

1	B003M60K54	A3QVUWJRPSL4CR	Thank God I found this food!	We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!	1	0
-1	B0030VJ8YU	A1B0RFUNJWZ35T	Why mess with a good thing?	What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily - so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken broth and a blender!

1	B003DA54UU	AHQ13I9CI4US6	Our dogs give Crunch 'n Clean Savory Flavors Mixed Reviews	Our vet recommends--nags--that we brush our dogs' teeth. Our dogs, on the other hand, think that's an awful idea and are not the least cooperative. Therefore, we try to give them treats that might have some benefit to their unbrushed teeth. Our puppy gobbles these down, no matter the flavor, but our senior dog (who is medium-fussy) will only eat the chicken. In general, she will not eat bacon or beef dog food, and apparently that applies to treats as well. So...in our house, 1 paw up, 1 paw down.	0	0
-1	B0030VBRIU	A2NYJV50NHOMFZ	Watery, flavorless, sour	Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried--they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing--very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves.	0	0

Perhaps it is a place that has a special steak, or perhaps our wife or our mother makes a special family dish that we savor.<br /><br />For those of us that love our pets, we sometimes want to offer our pets the same kind of treat. If this is you, Chef Michael has just the right food for your doggy's fancy. Made with good meat, what the company describes of ""garnishes"" of potatoes and green beans, and ""prepared with care"", this dog food attempts to spoil your puppy with dog food that promises healthy, yummy goodness.<br /><br />Our dog enjoys this food.

-1	B0007KLGC4	A2TVV3VAZH3480	Very low quality- and I'm not hard to please	"So let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of anything with marshmallows and/or mallow product of any kind. My boyfriend and I saw these and thought they sounded delicious, and they turned out to be a huge disappointment. The quality of the chocolate is terrible, I'm talking ""Russel Stover"" terrible: grainy, chalky, and hard. The ""mallo"" filling isn't too bad, but there isn't much of it, and the coconut is essentially non-existent. What you basically end up with is a mouth full of grainy, terrible chocolate flavor with sweet milky aftertaste from the wannabe marshmallow filling.<br /><br />If these things were more like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups with filling similar to the marshmallow in either Rocky Road candy bars or Hagen Dazz Rocky Road ice cream they would be awesome. And they should either have more coconut or none at all, because right now it only adds to the grainy texture without adding any flavor.<br /><br />Anyway, I seriously regret buying these- ESPECIALLY SINCE I LATER FOUND HUGE PACKS OF THEM AT THE DOLLAR TREE! -_-"	2	2

-1	B003D4OB4G	A16S9UOU4QRD6	Flat	I love several of the other Santa Cruz Organic sodas (Lemon/Lime & Pomegranate/Lime are awesome), but I don't care for this one at all. It has a root beer flavor, but something isn't right about it. It has lemon juice in it which seems odd to me, but I think the biggest problem is the low amount of carbonation.  Even a freshly cooled can tastes like it's been left open all day and then put back in the refridge.  The less carbonation works great in their fruity drinks, but not this one.  Also, at a 130 calories per can, you will not get skinny drinking this stuff.	0	1

-1	B000LKZ9IC	AZ2NZWEEPJ1JZ	Contains BPA!	I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better.  We already have enough cancer in our family.  I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products.  Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!	38	15

1	B003VN97GQ	ABWV99ZTZK5CQ	Can't beat this price!	I had been looking for this cruet set in local supermarkets without success, so was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price --- especially since I thought I was getting one cruet with two dressing packages, and the price is actually for 2 cruets and 4 seasoning packages! (This is a great price because a single package of dressing mix tends to run about $1.99 in the stores). The cruets are sturdy, come with suggestions for dressing variations, and bring back memories of when my mom used this same cruet to make salad dressing when I was a kid.

Traps are fairly easy to set, took a youtube video to help because the instructional drawings are a bit hard to understand by pictures alone.  The only downside to this trap is the width of it.  Our gopher holes are much narrower than this trapping mechanism so it took time to widen the hole enough such that this trap would work properly when placed in the hole.	0	0
1	B001EQ5MPW	A2HZKWV36U9SXM	I (Used to) Drink WAY Too Much of This Coffee	EDITED 01/2011 TO ADD: Henry's Blend is no more. This new teal-bag number 4 coffee may be presented as being the same 'balanced roast' that Henry's blend was, with nothing more than a fab new presentation... but don't be fooled. It's not just the bag that's changed: This stuff tastes like little more than brown water. YUCK!<br /><br />Original review (no longer applicable) follows:<br /><br />I originally bought Henry's Blend a few years back because it had a cat on it. They've since removed the cat, which is a shame because suckers for cat-promotions on coffee would totally pass this up as just another coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rather picky about my coffees. Previous to Henry's Blend I'd only truly enjoy something from our local bean roasters. I loathe Starbucks (tastes burnt to me), the other common brands all end up tasting watery and bland, but Henry's blend is just right - somewhere in the middle. It isn't too strong, it isn't too mild, and it has that stink that my mom calls the 'cat pee smell' (ironically) but not in a really intense way. More like mellow cat pee smelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I've tried others in the past few years but not one has had the right balance, and so back to Henry's blend I go. Its only drawback is that, at the rate I drink it, it's an awfully pricey habit to take up.	4	0
1	B000FL08B0	A2DUM0HFISATWV	So Much Better Than Regular Sugar	Blue Agave sweetener is the best I've ever used.  Been using it for over a year now, and has assisted in helping me lose the weight I've needed to.  Compared to using regular sugar as a sweetener, I only have to use 3 teaspoons of Blue Agave, whereas, I would have to use a minimum of 5-6 teaspoons of sugar to get the equivalent taste.  Blue Agave does not cause an increase in blood sugar like real sugar can.<br /><br />I use this on other foods such as, pancakes, waffles, as an ice cream topping and to sweeten just about anything one would normally use sugar for.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Blue Agave.	0	0

To top it off, there is a deal to get four 150g jars of Vegemite for $38 on Amazon from the same seller of the same exact product and brand. Hmm. . . 600g for 38$, 1800g for 115$ or 400g for 99$? Seriously though, what the heck is with this pricing Kraft?<br /><br />I may be wrong for assuming this, but the other reviews I have read for this product are for Vegemite in general, which does deserve 4~5 stars. This particular product however deserves a 1 and for good reasons."	2	13
-1	B005K4Q34S	A1SYHKAXCYCE20	Tastes like hot water	When I drink this, it tastes like flavored hot water. I think the powdered stuff you add water to that you get in the grocery store tastes way better. Won't be ordering this again.	0	0
-1	B0009ETA76	A377Z7HAFFGDOD	Not a Good Brand for Milk Supply	This brand did not help me with my milk supply.  I bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site, and found this to be inferior.  The capsules smell like medicine, not maple syrup, and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills, 3 x a day, I never got the maple syrup sweat like I did with the other brand.  I will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality.	4	1
1	B004CYLW7A	A3UUTDX2WNVUS3	Kellogg's Crunchy Roasted Nut	I am not a big fan of peanut butter, but I must admit to liking this cereal.  It is crunchy and quite tasty, with a light roasted peanut taste.  It was quite enjoyable and passed the test of my eight year old with excellence.  She loved it.  My box came with a nice $1.00 off coupon.  I recommend this if you like the taste of roasted peanuts, if not this will not be on your enjoyment list.	0	1
-1	B00112JV42	A2NE6IEOPGRXBT	Nothing special in this tea.  Weak in flavor and profile	I found this tea to be one of the weakest mint teas I have ever tried.  I also should mention that these are not foil wrapped bags, but are instead plastic wrapped.  If one is out for a better base level green mint tea go with Bigelow Green Tea with Mint instead of this.  Also want to give amazon a big thumbs down for shipping out such a short coded product not listed as such.	2	2
1	B000N8N45W	A3XKCQN182KA9	Yummy	It was a little spicier than I expected, but I like that.  You can save yourself work by only adding 1 1/2 packets of water to the noodles and vegetable packet mixture and microwaving for the  directed time.  Then you do not have to drain the water out before adding the yummy peanut sauce and peanuts. My second order is already shipping.	0	1

1	B000329OOI	A3ODKNXD86RZCI	HNC 4 eva	Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.  I prefer the 3-pack. I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50. This is a tremendous bargain. One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+. I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27.

-1	B005HG9ET0	A2V5M5EJPOD2IU	It is OK, but there is something that I can taste...	There is not much to say about water, I enjoy bottled water and always buy the packs of Dasani Bottled water from the local store.  I saw this item and thought it would be nice to give something else a try.  I poured me a glass of this water (I have had it chilling in the fridge for the day), and tried it, it tasted OK, and the water appeared beyond clear (kind of strange how clear the water was), it did have a small flavor or something, but I was not sure.  After I finished the glass I could still taste something in my mouth, it had an almost bitter flavor.  I got some tap water and washed my mouth out and that got rid of that bitterness.<br /><br />I am not sure what I am tasting in this water, but whatever it is, I do not care for it.  The bitterness is something I have tasted before, but cannot remember.  I think I will stick with Dasani or tap water.  This may just be my tastebuds and you may not have a problem with this water, but I could taste something and I did not like it.	0	0

-1	B0000CEU6T	A1SI3S5TOH21PQ	It's Okay ...	"Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a ""clean"" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it.  We do NOT recommend this particular coffee."	6	3
1	B003LPKETS	A10EEUSX92UPTZ	Excellent Low GI Carb Source For Shakes/Smoothies	"If your focus is health and nutrition you can't go wrong with this product.<br /><br />One of the first rules of sports nutrition is oats for breakfast.  Many people, like myself, either don't like the texture or taste of traditionally prepared oats, or simply prefer the convenience of 'mass gainer' shakes.  After doing my research, I'm convinced the myth of 'powdered' vs 'whole' grains affecting GI is insignificant.  Oat flour still retains the soluble fiber of whole oats, preserving its valued low glycemic properties.<br /><br />This product allows you to make a great shake that has all the health benefits of steel cut or rolled oats as a hot cereal.<br /><br />I prefer the following simple shake:<br /><br />2-4 ice cubes<br />1/2 cup oat flour<br />1 scoop vanilla whey protein (25g protein)<br />1 cup liquid egg whites (pasteurized and safe for raw consumption, 25g protein)<br />1/2 cup mixed frozen fruit (strawberries, bananas, peaches)<br />add water to the blending cup fill line (I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000ZP3LQ"">Tribest Personal Blender PB-100 Blender</a> with 16oz cups)<br /><br />This is a tasty, healthy, highly nutritious, protein rich, low GI carb breakfast."	4	4

-1	B004SRH2B6	A7MHWORF8251S	Zico coconut water is great, but you may get a bad batch	"I've ordered Zico Mango Coconut Water three times from Amazon. The first two times, the dozen I received were fine. This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a ""slightly imperfect"" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution."	9	0
1	B0090X8IPM	A1ILWPH1GHUXE2	HInt of vanilla, strong roasted flavor	"Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee has just a touch of natural vanilla infused into the coffee.  This results in a subtle vanilla aroma and a *very* subtle tinge of vanilla flavor in the coffee.  Perhaps it's just me, as I've never been able to discern much of the ""flavor"" in the vast majority of flavored coffees offered in coffee shops or for home brewing.<br /><br />That having been said, this Starbucks variety has a very distinct roasted aroma and makes a powerful cup of coffee.  I personally prefer a stronger roast flavor in my coffee and found this product enjoyable; if you also prefer this style of coffee then Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions is certainly worth a try."	1	0
-1	B001NYRMX0	A20VMSY4ZTIJP4	Has maltodextose in it.	This tastes great, kind of maple syrup like.  However, it is formulated with maltodextrose which is derived from real sugar.  I was seeking an all herbal sweetener similiar to stevia without additives.  Luo Han is an herbal/spice type sugar but the maltodextrose is clearly not.

1	B002YR7A9Q	A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	Comparing Bob's Red Mill to Tropical Traditions Shredded Coconut	"We select the best quality foods we can afford and this includes coconut.  This review is a comparison between the Bob's Red Mill and Tropical Traditions finely shredded coconut which I have been buying on their website - for some reason Amazon carries many of their products but not their coconut.<br /><br />Here is my comparison.<br /><br />Freshness- This item arrived with an expiration date of 3/2013, which is eleven months from delivery.  I wish I knew what the exp date was on the TT brand - but it lasted me well over a year on my shelf and I believe that since they harvest the Coconut (they are primarily a coconut products company) it may have been fresher.<br /><br />Price- I buy the Tropical Traditions in the plastic 3.5 gallon pail, which I buy online when it is half price at $17.50, which costs about $5 a lb.<br /><br />I decided to compare it to Bob's Red Mill which I researched and felt was probably the highest quality on Amazon, so I got it with the Subscribe n Save, so I saved a little more.  Without the Subscribe n Save, Bob's Mill has free shipping and currently comes to $4.38 a lb. I think Bob's Mill is priced well for what you are getting.<br /><br />Shred size- is very close - but the Bob's Red Mill is slightly larger.  I felt that the Tropical traditions was just a little too small for my taste.  It ""disappeared"" in my cooking and oatmeal and I never got to enjoy the crunch or the chew of it, only able to enjoy the flavor and smell.<br /><br />Dryness- both were equally dry and felt very similar.<br /><br />Aroma- the Tropical Traditions won hands down here.  The Bob's Mills smelled fresh enough, just a very mild slightly toasted smell.  But the Tropical traditions has a much stronger sweet coconut smell (it is NOT a sweetened coconut product) which I find very appealing.  And this is after sitting on my shelf for over a year! It was not rancid at all. Since both of these items are shredded finely, and as I said, I do not ""feel"" the coconut in my food, I'll probably go back to the Tropical Traditions line since that is what I am left to enjoy - the smell.<br /><br />Packaging-  I like that Bob's Mill is conveniently packaged in 4 backs so you can freeze three for later.  The Tropical Traditions comes in a plastic pail that is very very hard to open.  And then you really don't want to keep opening it.  Plus it does not fit in the freezer or fridge.  So the pail is a waste in my opinion.  I use mine for other things.<br /><br />I rate both products as 5 star items. Tropical Traditions wins if money and packaging are not an issue.  If they are then Bob's Mill wins handily.<br /><br />We eat a lot of coconut, I use it in my cooking and we eat it for breakfast.  We eat it at least 3 to 4 times a week in our oatmeal mixed in with organic flax seed, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036Q6DSS"">Flax USA 100% Natural Organic Flax Cold Milled Ground Golden Flax Seed, 40-Ounce Packages</a> home frozen blue berries (store bought have high pesticides) and maple syrup.  What a wonderful way to eat healthy!!! I find that adding coconut adds just enough protein, 1 gram, that I am able to last all the way through till lunch without getting that sudden hunger I get an hour or two earlier without the coconut."	12	0

1	B0030VBQOK	A1051DBTLWP5A2	Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!	"Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked ""interesting.""  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)"	0	0

1	B00122CM60	A2QTDL1XR2HTX	Great Soup!! Very Versatile.	Many people, including myself grew up on this soup. It was one of the few vegetables I looked forward to as a kid. This is my favorite vegetable soup, and I pretty much judge all others against it. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find this product in my area. In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it. But after ordering it in bulk, I found a few other uses for it.<br /><br />Normal Use- This soup is great just by itself. Add water and you are good to go. But it is best if you add your own touch to it. I suppose each family has their own way of using it. I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup. Perfect item to have on hand!!!	2	0
-1	B007OXJKCK	A3KCWQMEOLRC2U	Nice smooth flavor - but not strong enough for me	Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee.	0	0

When food was reintroduced we switched to Purina one smartblend puppy for large breed puppies. Some people may disagree but he loves it and is having no problems.

-1	B002T0NWKE	A32MNJDU9PMVWE	Diet lover's delite	I should have read the product description better. The artificial sweetner in the Lemon Lime mix creates a drink along the lines of Diet Sprite (or other lemon limey diet drinks). If you like diet lemon lime, then it's probably fine. I don't.	3	3

The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!	2	0
1	B007TJGZ5E	A3HL9RYE30WK9R	Nantucket is my favorite	So far I've had no problems ordering this product and receiving it as promised. I am a Nantucket lover and occasionally will buy a specialty/seasonal flavor on the side.Green Mountain is extremely expensive at most local stores! I've been buying bulk online for years. (I'm a coffee-holic) I suggest buying/trying a sample at your local store. (some even will let you brew a free cup!) Then, you can decide where your taste takes you! Happy sipping!	0	0

1	B000KEPBFU	A250AXLRBVYKB4	Oatmeal alternative	"I'd never heard of Kamut before it showed up in my Gold Box deals (since I had purchased some other Red Mill products), but decided to give it a try based on the positive reviews. I'm glad I did. As a hot breakfast cereal, it has a nutty flavor and a consistency similar to MaltoMeal, but is much better for you! The taste took a little getting used to (it's best with some milk and brown sugar) but I now like it quite a bit. I've added it to my breakfast mix, and alternate it with oatmeal. I've also started mixing in a tablespoon or two of flax seed from time to time. It also goes really well with fresh berries, or even frozen blueberries if you thaw them out first.<br /><br />While not quite supplanting oatmeal as my hot cereal of choice, Kamut has proven to be well worth the purchase; tasty, healthy, and organic. What more can you ask for from a product purchased on a whim?<br /><br />*****UPDATE 07/15/2010*****<br /><br />I tried making the ""Pharaohs Muffins"" recipe on the back of the package and loved it! I added chopped dates, raisins, and ginger, as well as a pinch of cinnamon. I also omitted the butter and sugar, and instead used apple sauce. The muffins turned out extremely well, and I'll be making them again. My wife also loved them, as did the coworkers I shared them with. They were pretty surprised to find out they clock in at 145 calories and have virtually no fat! So give them a try--they are worth it."	11	0

It si very rare for Amazon to mess something up, but they did this time.  Their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs.  You could never serve them in that condition.  But they make a fantastic crust.<br /><br />Lets face it, on this one item, Amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping.	2	1

-1	B002YJ0118	A2SMQKWWPJ6162	Good product except	This is a pretty good product in the fact that everything is pre mesured for you.  Just cut the top and pour it in.  The only problem for me was there was waaaay to much salt.  And since it is already in the product the heat makes it stick to the popcorn so each piece has a lot of salt.  You almost need to drink a lot of water during and after you eat this.  If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.  But if you like salt, its perfect for you, the best example I can think of, is that it does taste like and smell like movie popcorn, but purchase a movie popcorn and then pour about another 3 tablespoons of salt on it.	1	0
1	B00503DP0O	A357EQO27VKAF	delicious but fattening	"These bars have the texture of a soft cookie, and taste a lot like a chocolate chip muffin with coconut.  They are very tasty.  Also, if you love ""natural"" ingredients, you will likely be happy with these.  The drawback, however, is that they are 180 calories with only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. 80 of the 180 calories are from fat.  No wonder they are so tasty!  So these are something I would eat when I am not really trying to have a meal substitute, and am throwing dietary caution to the winds.  They are, however pretty filling and for that reason a great snack."	0	0

1	B000WFGOX0	AGH12M0P31R2	Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!	"My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!"	0	0

1	B000EM8UGU	A1MV4JYOZEDGNX	Refreshing peach iced tea	I love diet Snapple peach tea, however it is a bit pricey.

-1	B0057YHT4O	A2YJ7VWQK93XT5	Grossly overpriced for **tiny** cans	I was in a hurry that day and unfortunately I assumed that based on the price ($31 for 24 cans) that this would be the normal size cans (5.5 oz). That price is nearly as much as you'd pay for a case of the regular cans just about anywhere. Well, these are the teeny tiny cans - about one serving for just one of my cats. At $1.25 a pop, I can't afford to feed my cat using this reseller. This price is extremely high for these cans. Go to your local pet store if you want a reasonable price. Cat food is supposed to be cheaper by the case, not more expensive.	0	1

The reviews were good so I bought this based on that information.<br /><br />But I cannot gag this stuff down.  It looks very appealing in the cup and smells like it should taste good, but I really really do not like it.  I tried it for several days thinking it must be one of those aquired tastes, but it is still really gross to me.<br />I ended up giving the entire case away to a neighbor who did sort of like it.... so it isn't ALL bad.  Must just be me.<br /><br />In my opinion -- if you have not tried it, find someplace that sells it and give it a try before you buy a whole case.	3	2

1	B002YJ0118	A8QNV14F7U8O4	Dan's Perfect Popcorn	Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.	0	0
-1	B001E5E2GS	A32R0HBCV9FCJM	Buyers Beware...	For those of you out there that are new to gluten free foods...such as myself, the pasta experience will be quite disappointing.  Maybe it was just this particular brand...I don't know. Don't get me wrong...I love pasta and I consume it quite regularly. So when I suddenly switched to this new gluten free diet because you hear how much healthier it is, I thought I'll give it a try.<br /><br />First off, expect to cook the spaghetti longer then regular wheat pastas. The water will start to look thick and cakey. I suppose that's normal too. As you cook beware of the odor which I can't describe. The noodles will be very sticky so I advise putting in olive oil in the water but that didn't do the trick as well as I thought either. The noodles do have a heavier consistancy but as for the taste...it was just ok. It made me quite bloated after eating it. Wonder what that was about. Would I eat this again? No.	0	0
-1	B0061IUIDY	A146H4KN4LFR60	Tepid Tea	"I have always enjoyed a good ""cuppa"" and thought I had a lucky break when I had a chance to sample this new tea through the vine program. Unfortunately, the only good thing I can say about it is I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Folks, I gave it every chance. I brewed it strong, medium, weak. I had it plain, with milk, with lemon. I offered it to friends and family both tea lovers and haters. And we all had the same reaction:<br /><br />It has no flavor! For some reason, this tea is absolutely tasteless, flavorless and insipid.<br /><br />So what to drink?<br /><br />If you like a strong cup with milk you can't beat Yorkshire Gold. Awake by Tazo is a close second.<br /><br />If you prefer it medium strength Twinnings English Breakfast or PG Tips will do nicely.<br /><br />And while I'm at it, the most outstanding Earl Grey I've ever tasted was Rishi Silver Needle Jasmine.<br /><br /> Impra Black Currant makes a lovely iced tea.<br /><br />All of these may be purchased here at amazon."	0	0

I find it very difficult to get true chocolate flavor from almost any manufactured item, it always seems to be missing that deep flavor. I was pleasantly surprised with Serendipity, they nailed it.  The cost is a little high but I don't think you could do any better price-wise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used.  The best way to describe the flavor is  deep cocoa .  It's rich and dark, like hot chocolate.  It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although it's is cold.  The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches, you get to customize the flavor a little easier.  Because of the cost, it's a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite.

1	B002DHUCEM	A3O0FY6JTWCUTN	Very delicious but not a meal replacement	"I honestly don't know if this was supposed to replace a meal like Slim Fast(tm). It says it will satisfy hunger longer, this is mildly true. How much longer is up to each individual person. I would like it to satisfy more but what do you do to a shake to allow it to taste great, satisfy you even more, and not totally blow the overall appeal?<br /><br />Having spent many months drinking shakes as meal replacements (under doctor's care), I can say that these completely blow the taste of the other shakes out of the water. There is a taste that I always equate to vitamins in them but that's the added protein. Try drinking a protein powder and you'll see what I mean. It has a very high amount of protein for such a small serving, this alone makes it worth drinking no matter your size. The carbs are a bit higher than I'd like to see but that does come with the territory of protein and milk.  I bought the vanilla myself and had one chocolate from someone in the office who offered me a shake. I like vanilla because I can toss this into a blender and mix some fruit for a truly satisfying smoothie. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing to note is the price tag. At Wal-Mart (where I live) a 4 pack is $6.49, making that roughly $1.62 per bottle. Even with the ""amazon"" pricing of $43.68, each unit costs roughly $1.82. Sure, what's $.20 per for the convenience of ordering online? Nothing, it's just something to point out. The tax on the item in a B&M store is likely what makes ordering online only slightly worth it, again YMMV."	3	2

I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad.

Not sure<br />what problem is.  I was so looked forward to it because I couldn't<br />find them sold anyplace in town, so someone suggested Amazon.<br />Anyway,  I'm not sure what I did wrong because I called them the same<br />m<br />name that the bar had on theirs.  It wasn't in a jar but in a large<br />bag, I believe.	0	3

1	B002C56OBU	AD7DY0I7TCSGM	Community Hazelnut Coffee	Very pleased with this new coffee, thanx to another user comment and good review from someone recently when I was searching for a better priced coffee. Plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent; all the others are ridiculous on pricing I have noticed, increasing by $4 or $5 in some cases.  I was getting Maxwell House Hazelnut, but this coffee is much tastier; and Maxwell House has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing Community's bolder flavored hazelnut.  You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder, but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer, nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.  I just hope that now, finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price, Amazon keeps it in stock for awhile.	0	0

-1	B004U43ZO0	A1KEK09ZA6J9P8	nice idea, but needs a little work....	Ok, I haven't probably had a chips ahoy cookie since I was a kid or close to it, so I thought I'd give these new chewy gooey chocolate ones a go.  Here are the likes:  They are soft and chewy and the middle is nice and fudgy.  Dislikes: small cookies-2 cookies are a serving size and 150 calories and these cookies are about the size of a silver dollar, the cookies though soft and fudgy on the inside are dry on the top, if they were just a bit softer and less dry they would remind me of how fresh out of the oven cookies get that nice melty center when you hit the chocolate chips.  So, for me, this cookie is not quite there.  I didn't dislike them, but I wouldn't run out and buy a bunch of them.  If they were less dry I might purchase in the future.	0	0

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the ""Rodeo Drive"" or ""Breakfast in Bed"" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual."	0	0

-1	B000EDGBF6	A330NGCO9T42FB	Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer	I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!	1	0
-1	B000FDCRVC	A1U3L3BY4805J2	Pretty good, not great.	The price is comparable to brand name whole wheat pasta available to me locally so I have no complaint regarding that. The texture of this particular brand however is moderately  good. Some whole wheat pastas use a higher grade of  wheat making it lighter in color and slightly more tender ( Bionaturae and De Cecco  pastas comes to mind) . This pasta is darker in color and has a slightly grittier texture then those brands however it is still better then the bargain basement brands found for less. I found cooking it for slightly  longer then  the instructions call for and in a LOT of water helps to make it smoother. I would use a heavy, more robust sause for this pasta but otherwise we weren't really disappointed.	0	0

I can understand that this happens, but the plant was in horrible condition. It looked like nothing in the picture. I understand that this was not the same tree but it was apparent that the grower just lopped off the top of the tree and grew it like a plant. It looks horrible. My roommate was against me displaying it in our living room because of the crappy look it has. I was so disapointed I am an avid collector of  bonsai trees and it will take years for this bush to look like a tree again.

Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.<br /><br />2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.<br /><br />It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag.

Growing up, we always had from one to three dogs.  After leaving home, I've had two sets of dogs.  My first set of dogs were healthy until their 16th year.

So much of their hair turned white that by the time they were three, they both looked like senior citizens - especially their faces.  I have hundreds of photos to prove this.  They drink excessive amounts of water and I have a hard time keeping their weight down.  None of these problems have I experienced or even thought about with my previous dogs or with our family dogs when I was young.<br /><br />Tragically, on May 1, I put one of the present two ""to sleep"" at age 12.  That's why I've been reading dog food reviews today.  She and I spent 22 horrible and painful (and expensive) days trying to save her life, including having her gallbladder surgically removed.  My other dog has suffered from arthritis since age five, among other problems.<br /><br />After checking the reviews, I suspect their diet is the reason for most if not all of the problems stated above.  I feel guilty because I trusted the word ""premium"".  I feel guilty that even though I had suspicions throughout the years, I didn't look into it until it was too late.  It was just so easy to pick up their food at the grocery store.  Educating ourselves is more important than trusting that a label (such as ""premium"") means we're feeding them what is best for their health and well being.  I did everything in the world for my dogs---except give them a proper diet.  With the Internet at our disposal, that is unconscionable."	2	1
1	B001TZJ3OE	A13WOT3RSXKRD5	For a taste treat, substitute it for BBQ sauce	Once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor. Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving.	2	0

You taste the hint of movie theatre popcorn, but this popcorn is not fresh. We were very disappointed and couldn't even eat what we had popped. We have had this type of product by a different name and maker at a friends home, and their product exceeded this one with more freshness and taste  in every way. I wanted to return immediately, but Amazon policy for this item wouldn't allow it. The best popcorn is fresh popcorn. All the kernels popped; nothing burned.This is just old stale popcorn. Obviously, I would never buy it again, nor would I ever recommend it!	0	2

-1	B006BXUY2Y	A24J6PQ0FN55A6	Could be better	I love dark chocolate so assumed I would love these. Unfortunately, not so much. The texture was nice, chewy & not hard. The taste left something to be desired. The dark chocolate is really dark. There was very little sweetness to these bars. They also had a sort of flour taste to them. I looked in the ingredients & did find some various flours listed, including peanut flour for those with peanut allergies. They were just ok for me. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them. I'll stick with the Fiber One Chocolate 90 calorie bars.	1	0

-1	B000CMF196	AQ6B2UAFBL2PK	Not their best!	I love blueberries, green tea and Yogi Teas but I do not like this!  It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid, didn't like it then, don't like it now.  Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste!  Yuck.  I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed.  This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up.  Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice! Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book!	1	2
-1	B001PMC3PM	A1AVKD9PFDCRB5	too rich for my dog, gave her black poo	I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.	1	0

-1	B002GWFANW	A1IVBMSQGMQXGZ	A mild coffee, not for you dark roast lovers.	I bought this coffee with the basic requisites that it must be Fair Trade, and not too strong, as I prefer a breakfast or house blend for my morning coffee routine.<br /><br />I am basically pleased with this blend, I am enjoying my first cup as I write this review. Although I prefer a light/medium roast, this might be a little too light and mild, even for my tastes.  If you prefer a very light roast, then this would be perfect for you.  It is otherwise smooth and seems like low acidity (my stomach isn't upset by it or anything) which are both great pluses.  Since I prefer my coffee a little darker than this, I will probably just add an extra scoop of coffee to the pot to get it up to my taste preference.<br /><br />I wish Coffee Bean Direct made a darker roasted fair trade coffee, b/c the price sure is right!  Just as an FYI - BJ's Sumatran Fair Trade is very tasty medium/dark roast, and it's actually a little cheaper than Coffee Bean Direct's fair trade.<br /><br />enjoy!	5	1
1	B000WFM9QQ	A7JW9WS18LOKX	This is the ONLY food my dog will eat	I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.	4	0
-1	B0049FLNCQ	ALYTC4QFJAA57	Don't waste your money like I did!	"I scoured the internet looking for a healthier protein shake and came across Svelte.  I remember seeing it at Whole Foods because I loved the packaging and the fact that its resealable so I didn't have to drink it all at once.  That's where the positives for me stopped though.<br /><br />Svelte boils down to soy milk , sugar alcohols, and sugar!  I took one to the gym and my trainer looked at the bottle, laughed and handed it back to me saying ""just buy some soy milk, it's cheaper, you get the same protein and probably tastes better.""  He then went on a rant about how much he doesn't like soy protein.  I don't care about that part as much but the taste was really artificial.  My favorite one was cappuccino, chocolate and vanilla tasted really bad and the spiced chai one was even worse.<br /><br />Folks, don't waste your money, just blend your own shakes!  And maybe do some research on soy, apparently it's not good for you like I initially thought."	1	2

Not saying they don't taste good, but just don't taste the same as before. What happened? I have no idea. Maybe it's an attempt to simulate more cheese flavor, but put it back to what it was."	2	0

1	B001TLY7A8	A2JP6PEBS5Y2WK	Great Food - Cats Should NOT Eat Dry Food	"I don't know why this is not known to everyone, everywhere, but cats should eat a grain free, wet food diet. They cannot digest or get any nutrition from grains, so there is no reason for grains to be in cat food, yet to save money, they put it in. Also, cats naturally have a very low thirst drive, and with the correct diet, they will hardly ever drink water. If they are on a dry kibble diet, they will have to drink to get their water, and with the low thirst drive that is natural, a lot of cats don't get anywhere NEAR the amount of water they need. Cats on a dry food diet are likely to have kidney problems or urinary tract problems that could be prevented just by changing to a wet food diet. This is so important, and I urge everyone who loves their cat to get them off the dry food, and over a couple weeks, switch them to a grain free, wet food diet. Sorry to be preachy, but the word needs to be spread!<br /><br />This Weruva food is a big hit with my kitty, and it is a proper grain free wet food that makes sure he is getting the water he is supposed to get. Yes, it is canned in Thailand, but it is in an all human grade food facility. I would be much happier if it was all done in the US, but it has been reviewed by reputable sources and scored well. The other bonus, at least with the chicken flavors, is that they smell good! No stinky cat food smell, but in fact smells like something you might want a bite of. The cashier at the pet store I used to get this food from said he had eaten it, and it was good! Of course, it is also important to give them a variety, so I give him some of the ""fishy"" ones too, but the chicken smells great. I would recommend this food, but whether you feed this one or another one, please feed a grain free wet food diet to your cats!"	0	1
-1	B002LANN56	A2WB4OWBUH2VQX	She LOVED the taste, but not so healthy	I will echo the concerns about the healthiness of this product but without question, my dog ate this food like nothing else I've given her. The odor is<br />not overly strong and it does appear to be a nice mix of meat and vegetables. I will be using this as a supplement to her normal dog food, which is much healthier but for a little treat, I'll mix this in with her food. The pellets are small enough that you could use these bits as a snack and not for the principal meal.	0	0

I used 8 oz of water and when that was too strong I watered it down but that did nothing to diminish the ginger. In fact the tea even had a ""hot"" taste as if there was chili in it. I'll pass on this one."	2	1

-1	B003MWBFMK	A101P2KHWCU0G6	Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!	I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!	0	2

After reading such positive reviews on this cereal, Special K Cereal, Vanilla Almond 17.5 oz, I purchased it at my grocery store, which it is called Value Size, not Family Size, but it is the same size, and the same cereal.<br /><br />I thought maybe it would be my new favorite cereal.  Boy was I wrong!!<br /><br />First of all it is sickenly sweet, beyond belief!!  In one serving there was ONE slivered almond!!  I didn't taste vanilla at all!<br /><br />One bowl was enough.  Now Iam sorry that I purchased this larger size thinking I wanted enough to last me awhile.  Now my thinking is that I just have a larger box of this cereal to give away, and at $4.79 for this box of cereal I think I definitely wasted my money!<br /><br />I think I will go back to Special K Red Berries with I did like, and have purchased quite alot of it in the past.<br /><br />I would expect more from the Special K Brand.

-1	B000GG1O94	A1P2XYD265YE21	Cinnamon Way Too Strong	I love peach tea (and anything peach flavored), but this has has a cinnamon flavor that is too strong. I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't be honest if I did. I don't like the cinnamon flavor. To me, peach and cinnamon don't belong together. Peach is summer and cinnamon is winter. This tea might be better in the winter as hot tea, but then again, not, because peach is too summery. Cinnamon would go better with apple flavor. As soon as I finish this box, I will not buy it again.<br /><br />The cinnamon is way too strong.  It made me sick at my stomach, and the aftertaste is horrible.	1	0

1	B000F9Z1WI	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?	"I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of ""A Star Is Born"" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack."	1	0

The back of the bars are stuck (perhaps melted?) to the plastic wrapper and can only be removed by scraping off small, individual pieces. I ordered these Cranberry Almond bars along with the Kind Apricot Almond and Mango Macadamia Nut bars.  The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money.	0	0

1	B004TNXDDU	A680RUE1FDO8B	Luscious!	I am addicted to these candies. They have a somewhat hard, but still chewable outer shell and a wonderfully sweet jelly filled center. The fruit flavors are strong and last throughout the short life of the candy.<br /><br />  They're expensive for what you get, but like I said, I'm addicted.<br /><br />  I wish I could buy the flavors ala carte, in which case, I would buy very little if any of the lemon, which is my least favorite.<br /><br />  Since my grandchildren discovered these on the kitchen counter, my supplies diminish all the quicker.<br /><br />  Judging from my own experience, a lot of people won't like these candies. They have a very intense taste and the jelly filling can stick to your teeth for a moment or two until you swish it away with your tongue.<br /><br />  But then there are the people like me who could eat them all the time.<br /><br />Jerry	1	0
1	B0012KOQ2K	AFP8PB588WXII	Divina Olives Stuffed with Jalapeno are simply the best!!	I received my first jar as a gift at Christmas.  I have tried several different brands of olives stuffed with jalapenos but none compare to these.  They are not too spicy or salty and have just the right amount of jalapeno added for flavor.  They are perfect any time of the day.  I definitely recommend this item.	1	0
1	B000GQTP1S	A1VU5Q1CE8L8EX	Great chips for a pepper enthusiast	These chips are the hottest chips I have tried. Above being hot, they have a very good smokey taste.

-1	B0009YJ4CW	A3F1I93M82GJER	Non-everlasting treat ball	I bought this for my daughter's dog. He is a hybrid, probably Australian cattle dog and Jack Russell and weighs less than 40 lbs. It took him all of 2 minutes to figure out that he could get the large treat out of the ball by getting one canine tooth under the edge and pulling. The second one came out even faster! The treats themselves did take him about 5-10 minutes to eat. As far as entertainment value and boredom relief while in his kennel? I couldn't even give it to him in the kennel because the ball itself was too easy to chew up once the treats were out of it.<br /><br />Not impressed, not worth the money, doesn't do what it's advertised to do, won't bother ordering more of the treats to fit it as they are quite expensive and I can keep him entertained longer with a Kong or Nyla Bone. Modification in design so the treat doesn't pop out so easily might fix it, but at this point, for the price, don't bother.  Waste of 20 bucks.	0	0
-1	B000MDCDNM	A1RQZJUH4NCQGP	Survival food	Not too good. May be good if squeezed dry and added with mayo + crunchy veggies into tuna salad. I had this + crackers and the flavor was quite overwhelming. Very lemon pepper?!!?? Ha ha ha. I know, it is very lemon pepper but it is quite intense. I'll try as the base of a tuna salad, it may be better, but I think I'll sick with my plain ole' tuna. Worth a try if you are looking for something different, just not for me though. Texture was nice. Not to clumpy, but not overly processed and fine. Not terribly mushy.	0	1
1	B000G6RYNE	A2OEUROGZDTXUJ	I like them.	"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it.""  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me..."	1	1

1	B000PDY3P0	A124CX9PR93OLY	Best Popcorn Yet	My husband and I had been using a different type of popcorn for our popper, but in looking into purchasing it the last time, it was quite expensive so we started looking around for something new.  In our search we came across this popcorn and thought we should give it a try.  We got the same amount of popcorn for half the price, which was huge bonus for us.  Once we received it, we had to try it right away and we were thoroughly impressed with it.  It is even better than the previous brand.  Fabulous product!	0	0
-1	B0012NUVN0	A3EMLCORHSALKD	Really depends on the dog	I bought this after seeing my greyhound going crazy for it at the vet's office. But now that he has one, he couldn't care less about trying to eat the treat disk that came with the product. However, he does like the dry kibble that I stuff in the bottom. But for that purpose alone, I suggest getting a large gatorade bottle and using a knife to make a small hole on the side.	0	0

Then there's the ingredient list:<br /><br />Water, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, natural and artificial flavors, Phosphoric Acid.  Doing a bit of research, I find that while propylene glycol is what goes into modern antifreeze and hand sanitizers, the US FDA has determined that it is ""generally considered safe.  According to the rest of the reading, it would take a LOT to cause a problem.  But my question is: Why are we using it at all?  Is there nothing else that will do the job?  Theoretically, it's an alcohol, but then again wood alcohol makes people go blind, so...<br /><br />Lots of questions, no conclusive answers.  I'll likely try a drop or two, but I wish Amazon had revealed this in the first place.  At $8.xx, it's not responsible to the carbon footprint to ship it back... but that doesn't mean I've go to like it.<br /><br />EDIT: put a couple drops into some oil... it doesn't mix.

-1	B000TK6LBS	A1WD9DNSLLB9KZ	I wonder what others were talking about?	I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full-flavored coffee and this is not it.  There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other.	0	0
-1	B007POT6RM	A1NNT24UATVJ6G	What happened???	When I was younger, I used to eat the Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal all of the time- I was torn between it and Strawberries & Cream as my favorites. I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome.	0	0
-1	B0009YJ4CW	A2T5VSWN46FFAI	My dog will not touch this toy.	I gave the ball with the treat stuck inside to my dog yesterday. He would not go anywhere near it. He sniffed the toy and treat and then walked away and it hasn't been touched since. I think what's turning him off is the smell of the plastic ball itself. It has a VERY strong fake-vanilla scent to it which is unpleasant to humans but must be overwhelmingly gross to a dog. By the way, my dog is not at all picky. He will play with anything and eat anything so this is a real first!<br /><br />Also, I looked at the ingredients for the treat and it's all absolute junk. The first ingredients are wheat and gluten.	2	0

-1	B005K4Q1W2	A3VCC0LYLD7942	Okay if using right after purchasing, but....	I loved these when I ordered and used them last year.  I kept an extra box in a cool, dry place over the summer.  When i went to make a cup tonite, was dissapointed that it simoly tasted like hot water.  Figuring that it might have been just one pad pod, tried FOUR additional pods with the same result.  Checked the box and expiration is next month....but no warning on the mix evaporating in the cups.  What a waste....very dissapointing since i had thought this was a great drink to curb cool weather munchies.	1	0

-1	B000I6MCYI	A3UP8N4590K0UP	Very disappointed...again.	My wife and I were looking forward to a great cup of Highlander Grogg after all the great reviews, however, the flavor of this coffee was very disappointing. I have been drinking various Highlander Grogg coffees since the early nineties and this is not it. The HG I have come to know has a very recognizable caramel-butterscotch-rum-nutty flavor. The coffee beans are over-roasted and taste like burnt nuts with not a hint of the other before-mentioned flavors. I was also disappointed with Coffee Bean Direct's version of HG. So far, only Grounds For Coffee and Cameron have the right recipe. We would have given it another star had we enjoyed drinking it even a little bit. The search goes on.	0	0
-1	B0012BUR6S	A3J171NBGIBYAW	Not for Me	I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.	0	0

1	B002AQ0OL2	A3W16SXDCVOJLJ	Great Value Coffee for Keurig	I have bought several variety packs and specific roasts from various producers through Amazon, and I have settled on this Breakfast Blend for my primary use.  Most of the roast you find for Keurig are bold/dark roasts, and I really do love me some dark roast!  Sometimes, though, you need a lighter, less intense brew.  For those who are searching for this balance - search no more.<br /><br />When brewed with the large cup setting, this is a medium bodied consistently good drink.  When you want a little more flavor, just brew it on the small setting.  It will still be more mellow than most of the palate pounders available right now.<br /><br />I have bought this breakfast blend in bulk several times now.  It is a great value and a great brew.	27	2

I dream of them and looked forward to trying this. This was a nightmare :P  &lt;--- that was exactly what my face looked liked.<br /><br />I wish companies would be at least label their products that have artificial sweetener... as in this case sucralose. Sucralose has a nasty after and beginning taste in my opinion. I don't ever buy products intentionally that have this in it. If you don't mind sucralose, then it probably wouldn't bother you.<br /><br />However, if you dare to continue and try your own cup. Let me warn you. It doesn't have a coffee flavor. Or maybe a mild one.I couldn't get passed the sucralose taste. It is instant coffee as well. (no grinds in the filter left)<br /><br />As suggested by others stick to the reg. coffee and add some Andes mints or your own favorite hot chocolate to it.	1	0

-1	B001GQ3E3M	A21XHU9D672WYM	Meh, I think I like Justin's better	I wanted something like Reese's peanut butter cups, but this has neither enough chocolatey flavor nor peanut buttery.  It needs to be both saltier and sweeter.  It's just like a sort of bland peanut butter w/some unsugared cocoa powder thrown in.  The cocoa powder makes it drier and less oiler, which definite decreases the mouth-feel pleasure for me.  Seems like diet peanut butter w/choco added to make people feel less deprived.  I won't throw it out, but I went back and got Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter instead. I know it's like oranges and tangerines - not exactly the same, but I still think Justin's has a better concept for the heft and creaminess needed as well as a better level of salt.

I carry them around in a ziplock bag for the much needed sugar rush at school and they get more chewy after about an hour out of the fridge.

This weekend I just tried a couple of new flavors I found in a store, Sweet Potato BBQ and Sweet Potato with salt and pepper. Oh my gosh good. My husband likes the Jalapeno kind. I generally don't care for spicy things and was hesitant to try that flavor, but it wasn't bad spicy, and just had an all around great flavor like all the others. Add in the fact that they are gluten free, all natural, AND non-GMO.....goodness, if they were only organic I think I'd pass out!	0	0
1	B001E6TWIU	A33QINQ8YJZENU	Great diet aid	I've been using coconut oil supplements to help my post-baby weight loss diet and I really feel like it's helped. Especially for those meals where my will power fails and my family is dying to eat out and I eat a little less than as healthy as I want. Usually I would put a little bit of weight back on after those episodes but with the coconut oil the fat doesn't hang out in my body and my weight stays the same. Also my hair looks and feels wonderful and my skin is softer. I take two with lunch and two with dinner rather than four at once also. Great product! Sometimes these types of pills smell or taste funky before you can swallow them or give me some indigestion. But not these. The pills are pretty large though.	8	0

-1	B000RI1W8E	A32483Y7JE893P	What the **** is in these things? Wait, no..nevermind. I don't want to know.	This is NOT food. Not for humans at least. Maybe a quasi-meat-flavored alternative to Ex-Lax. If you're lucky, you will only be spewing orange sludge from one bodily orifice at a time after you eat one of these. Shiva step aside if you eat more than that. On a positive note, my dog really likes them, so I give this two stars.	6	8
-1	B000EIRQNW	A1MD0XE1BJQPKX	Not what was pictured	The Thai yellow bean paste pictured is not the brand that was sent.

We are very familiar with the brand that is pictured becasue we buy it locally in the Aisian MArkets.<br /><br />The brand sent was not the brand advertised in the photo	9	1
1	B001LXYA5Q	A2QQPCYJZ7RTBS	Wow.	It was crazy, it made things taste super sweet, some things not at all though. However, this deliverer was extremely reliable and i receiver my package a day EARLY. A first for me with Amazon!	0	0
1	B004LTDNDM	A1Z3XWG2W5GOHP	A great healthy snack!	I bought a big bag of this stuff at my local Costco after doing research on dried fruits with oils....not so good for you after all.  This is great because there are no preservatives at all; just dried apples, cherries and grapes.  Plus it's all organic so how could you go wrong?  A funny statement on the back says may contain pits, core fragments and stems - Hey it's real food!  Haha that gave me a good laugh.  This is how dried fruit is supposed to be!  A note with the apples - at first they seem to have a rubbery texture, but the more you keep chewing them, the sweeter and tastier they get.	1	0
-1	B000EHOZS2	A1XQMQMF07QZQS	Terrible low quality pressed bits in tiny bags	This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky. It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags. The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful.	0	5
-1	B004WTHCO2	A1K7C1WFWUT7Y3	Poor design, extremely unhealthy	Like others have said, the reservoir is impossible to clean.  It has many crevices and is very dark with a small opening for a brush.  Mineral deposits even with a thorough vinegar wash/steam.  The metal inside also looks like it is coated in toxic chemicals like Teflon.  I didn't think about the plastic leaching until after I bought it, but of course plastic heated leaches.  It does not matter if it is bpa free, it's still plastic and it still has chemicals.  The cleaning required for this machine is exhaustive!  I wanted this cause a blog writer said how much it saved her time, but I can't see how that is true.  I am so regretful that I wasted my money on this.	0	0
-1	B001BCVY4W	AF3BYMPWKWO8F	Warning: Contains Menadione	"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."	0	0
-1	B000ELGPAO	ABJ9NIC5CIZ6L	Missing a big piece	The only thing I see missing is a little screw-top-like thing for the filter.

-1	B00275QC9O	ATKV4EY4UGGT5	Olde Thompson Garlic Pepper	This product is not really what I expected it to be.  There is not enough garlic flavor and too much sea salt.  I bought the product because I am a big lover of garlic and of black pepper so I thought with this product I couldn't go wrong.  I was disappointed because the sea salt really overpowers everything else.  The name of the product should actually be Sea Salt with a hint of garlic and black pepper.  I have only used a small amount of one of my jars and it will probably be a while before I even start on the second.  This is not a product I would ever buy again.	1	0
-1	B000F9Z1YG	A2582KMXLK2P06	not good	I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).	0	0
-1	B001QKGLOM	A192BI67CP8HW6	Okay, not the best	We heard this was the best stuff out there, Ordered and weren't all that excited.

-1	B003R0LKTK	A35R32TA60XD57	Disappointing.	I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here.  He barely sniffed it and walked away.  I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list.  I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it.  Too bad though.  I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat.	1	0
-1	B0061IUKDM	A1MBXP3NZM2BUO	Horrible taste	I drink green tea almost every day and I always stick with the traditional ones. I don't like other flavors in my tea. Personally, this one tastes horrible. I just can't stand the combination of lemon balm and verbena and green tea. Well, if you want to try something new, you may want to consider this product. If you're a traditional green tea consumer like me, you should avoid it.	1	0
1	B000FL08B0	A3QJPVSL7GLLXM	Organic  Raw  Blue Agave Sweetener	This product is great for baking, sweetening coffee, or any other use that you would use sugar or syrup for. It's taste is not overpowering and it doesn't punch your system the way sugar does.	5	0

We thought she was going to die, She wouldn't eat and only drank a little.I thought cat sure was like people sure and tried it. We freeze the whole can in Ice cube trays and give her one a day. She loves it. She seemed to come alive again. Shaking it in the can dosen't mix it well. We use a can opener and pour a bit out and use a small electric mixer to mix it (A lot of it settles on the bottom)  But she loves it.	12	0
-1	B002T0GXNC	A3FFMER98HCVN3	great idea, needs work	Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute.	2	2
1	B0018SPTKE	AAX9ZIMIYJ77W	Good Mood Food	I'm not familiar with this band. I picked up Herr's BBQ chips at a snack stand in a medical plaza. They were tastier that I thought they would be. Crispy, sweet, and salty. However, I still prefer Lays BBQ chips as my number one choice though.  I paid only 99 cents for a one ounce bag. Worth it.	0	0

-1	B003WO51JG	A1SMVI75746Q4E	Too tart	I make Crystal Light Lemonade at home in a pitcher and add some Ocean Spray Diet Cranberry to sweeten it and it's delicious.  When I saw this product it seemed like a great idea to have at work.  I was very disappointed.  It tastes too tart, not at all sweet.  It's basically lemonade.  I hope that they will reformulate this so that it has a sweeter cranberry taste. If I can do it right when I make it at home, they should be able to also.	1	0
-1	B000EHW0WA	A2PXZD2UBV49RZ	Chocolate Mousse Organic	I have always used the Nestle Mousse, but since they have stopped making it I bought this kind.  It is very fluffy, but not quite as sweet as the Nestle.	0	0
-1	B007I7YZJK	A2GPJR489OIH42	the good and the bad	"On the plus side, the tea mixed fairly easily without any residue remaining on the bottom - stirring with a spoon in a glass is adequate. That was important to me since convenience and ease in making it are part of what makes me want to buy it. I thought it was very sweet and refreshing, and my husband enjoyed it.<br /><br />On the negative side, it was almost too sweet for me, but if you add more water (obviously) that helped. What I couldn't change was the taste itself, and I thought there was a bit of an ""aftertaste"".  I don't know whether or not it's just because I just don't like the taste of the acai, which I've never had before.  I think I would have preferred just the strawberry. But if you are a fan of acai I would say you should try this and it may end up being ""your cuppa tea""."	0	0
1	B000E80BIE	ARENGZFNYZUK0	Y.U.M.	Between this, and the coconut soup, we're in olfactory heaven right now (stranded hours away from the nearest decent Thai restaurant).<br /><br />When you can't go out, and you don't want to fuss with hard-to-find ingredients and lengthy cooking, this is a fantastic alternative! A little on the spicy side for some tastes perhaps but we LOVE it!	1	0
-1	B002LANN56	A2VUNCELWAV29X	Better as a Treat	"I know this dog food is supposedly healthy and packed full of nutrients, but I just can't shake the pet-owner's gut feeling that it's not necessarily the healthiest. It is though, a GREAT little ""appetizer"" that I add to the top of my dogs' regular food that gets them to start eating (they're both a little picky). They love the abundant chunks of meat and I think it adds a little variety to their meals. I will probably keep a bag on hand to add a little to their regular food as a way to encourage them to eat, since they obviously really, really like it (I caught one of my dogs with his head in the bag in the laundry room)."	0	0
-1	B005K4Q1W2	A23UW1116PTM1Q	It's OK	Out of the 3 products I've purchased from Grove Square, this is my least favorite.  For me it seems to have too much spice flavor and not enough apple.  It's not something I won't drink, just a little disappointed in the overall taste.	0	0

This is my ""cheat"" snack and not bad for 21 chips at 120 calories.  I've gotten other people hooked on these too.  Love 'em"	0	0
-1	B004IJFZ54	AMHHNAFJ9L958	These taste so bland.	Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.  They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar.  Wow.  Super bad.	0	1
1	B001EQ55RW	A34VCCL1YO6D0I	Very Tasty.  Very Good.	This is a very tasty and very good snack.  I absolutely love these.  I am a fan of almonds anyway so it wasn't a stretch when you combine almonds with another one of my favorites, dark chocolate, and you have a winner.<br /><br />The almonds taste fresh and as always they are meaty and filling.  I can enjoy these at about 7 or 8 at a serving which seems to me to be about the serving size at  cup.<br /><br />Although these aren't unhealthy in the sense that there is a lot of junk added they certainly are not a weight loss tool.  At 150 calories per serving and 110 of that from fat you would be in serious trouble if this replaced baby carrots on your menu.<br /><br />All in all a very tasty treat.  I give it four stars instead of five only because of the high fat content even if it is healthier fats.	0	0
1	B001FSK3I0	A1IOVPNRBP7OH5	go to Amazon when you can't find in locally	I was so frustrated - they hooked me on this product at the local Walmart and then stopped carrying it.

1	B003GSK4CW	A11OTLEDSW8ZXD	Best deal on AMZ for bottle pumps	These pumps are very durable.  I've been using the same pump for over a year for my Torani coffee syrups and have no problem with them whatsoever.  The fit is perfect and I never have syrup running down the side of the bottle. The only thing I make sure I do when changing the bottles is rinsing out the pump as sugar crystals can dry around the pump mechanism and cause the pump to get stuck.  Cleaning is easy:  just let the pump soak in clean, warm water (no soap necessary) and then pump water through it a few times to blast away the remaining sugar residue.  Maintaining these pumps this way prolongs the life of the pump.<br /><br />This five-pack is the best deal on Amazon.  Others sold separately cost more by other shippers because of the added shipping costs.  A five-pack now allows me to keep several bottles of different syrup flavors available to chose from while making my morning cappuccino.	18	0

1	B004TI4SIE	A3IB2W44VEFSID	Ginger Honey tea granuals	These are a staple in my pantry.  I make a two litter bottle of green tea with one or two packets of the ginger honey tea added.  I love the flavor and I don't get acid kick-back anymore.  I drink the honey ginger tea hot for a sore throat. It is wonderful in apple juice or other fruit juices as it give a punch to the drink.<br /><br />I also make a drink from green veggies and some fruit. This ginger honey really livens it up and makes it delicious. When I make shortbread cookies, I sprinkle this ginger on top before baking. I won an award for the cookies at a Scottish festival.  I buy 3-4 of the large bags at a time. It doesn't last long around here.<br /><br />It is great to sip on the front porch with neighbors and can be served hot in the winter and iced in the hot summers.	2	0
-1	B001LMT1CY	A31P18E0M2O5M1	Interesting	It's a chocolate bar with crumbled bits of real bacon inside, not a whole slice of bacon. I bought 7 of these as Christmas gifts for friends and family. Later, when I asked each person how it was, they all said Interesting or Different. None of them loved it and they all agreed it was too salty, but they still enjoyed trying it. This is a funny, unusual gift, but don't expect anyone to eat more than one.	0	0

1	B001EQ569Y	AYG2M6ZS1JTBR	Don't Eat Steak Without It	Emeril's Steak Rub is an excellent product. I love the way it makes steaks taste and I would be very disappointed if I had to broil a steak without first seasoning it with Emeril's Steak Rub.<br /><br />I can't figure out why this product isn't available in stores. The way I learned about the product is when I bought my brother a cute little steak kit. I bought the set for him and decided to buy one for me. I was hooked. But when I went to the store to buy more of the steak rub, I couldn't find it. Anywhere. I searched in different supermarkets, gourmet shops, kitchen stores, all to no avail.<br /><br />Finally it occurred to me that I should look for the product online. And when I found it -- where else, but on Amazon -- I bought it in bulk; i.e., a six pack. I just bought my second six pack.<br /><br />Delicious!	0	0

I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.<br />I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.<br />What a waste of my hard-earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is.<br />Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again.

What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan, kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.

And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM"">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner."	0	0

-1	B0010UOGWM	AES43KF278B9B	Contains SPLENDA - yuck	"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind."	24	14
-1	B001EO5ZAG	A127K87I8I1V94	Perfect gift basket for anyone	It's good hot chocolate, but it does taste more sugary than chocolate which is slightly disappointing given this is premium hot chocolate. There is a slight hint of hazelnut, but yeah I think it is marketing to sell sweeter hot chocolate, which is what most of the cheaper hot chocolate companies do.	0	0
1	B004JLCRLG	A2FKH3DILCQSHT	Strong Oolong with Mint flavor and a hint of chocolate	I enjoy this tea.  However, it should be thought of more as a mint tea than a chocolate mint tea.  I was looking for a flavored Oolong tea since I prefer flavored teas and read that Oolong is much better than green for fat burning (by the way I've lost 30 pound in the last 6 months by drinking tea instead of my Starbucks mocha and removing artificial sweeteners, sugar and wheat flour from my diet so there is probably something to this). This has the potential to be a very strong tea, which I prefer.  The chocolate is most prevalent if you take the teabag early and opt for a weak tea.  Even then, it is just of hint of chocolate not a strong chocolate flavor.  As the tea sits longer, the mint and tea flavors tend to overwhelm the chocolate so there is just the barest hint left.  The mint flavor is definitely strong enough that you can sweeten with Stevia instead of sugar or artificial sweeteners and not notice anything wrong with the taste.	0	0
1	B001O2DGY0	A3LWC833HQIG7J	Twice the protein of other Earth's best and baby food in general	The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended.	0	0

1	B0018CJYPG	AAU3TOHIK4552	Superb, top of the line dry dog food	I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.	1	0

1	B007M83302	A1HBC0NBQJHT7X	Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute	One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.	73	4
-1	B004YV80OE	A392BGTO28EN6V	Too sweet for my liking	"I tried this and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80O4"">Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. I'm not a big fan.<br /><br />Both are easy to follow and you just need to have the meat to go with the meal.<br /><br />I found the seasoning bland compared to the cheeseburger mac, and the Velveeta very sweet. I didn't add any salt to balance it out, since processed foods usually come packed with enough sodium. I didn't expect much from the broccoli included, but it did come out decent.<br /><br />While the product was still edible, it's not something I'd buy unlike the Cheeseburger mac."	0	0
1	B004OLKF60	A33JTFRM6S378Q	Rich and Delicious	Some time back I ran into an offer of free samples of Barista Prima Coffeehouse Coffee.  When the samples arrived, I fell in love with the brand.  It's rich and delicious.  Now, it's what I use on a regular basis.  Had I not had the samples, I would never have known that this brand I had never heard of would be a stand-out.

Unfortunately, the glass material makes it bulky and hard to not dribble when you're drinking. Also, it's hard to store since I can't put it with my other utensils since it might roll around and break. So yes, I probably wouldn't buy another one but it's fun to use once in a while.	0	0
-1	B001LGGH54	A2VJJ2POCLMED7	Apple juice by any other name...	I received my sample from Amazon and the first thing that I did was pour it into a glass, over ice. While it's not bad, one thing that I will mention is that it just didn't taste like watermelon or strawberry...the taste is overwhelmingly that of apple juice...plain old apple juice. There are quite a few juices listed in the ingredients, including some not-so-common ones (acerola for instance), but I'm guessing the quantities were trace-like at best. Nope, what you get here is carbonated apple juice with maybe a hint of the berries' tartness...any watermelon flavor is lost somewhere in the mix, which isn't particularly surprising. Frankly, the effervescence is more pleasing than the actual taste.<br /><br />It's not really bad, I'd drink it again, but there are healthier things out there that you could be drinking. It might not have sugar added, but the sugar that's naturally in the juice is more than enough. All-natural doesn't always translate to good-for-you, which is something that seems to go over the head of some individuals. It might be better than soft drinks, but there really isn't much nutrition to be found here. All-in-all, it might be a good thing to toss in to mix things up a bit, but it's not something I'm going to think is going to turn my life around, or be particularly noteworthy when it comes to pleasing to my palette.	0	0

-1	B002GPNT32	A9LWNO452P7UU	Not Crazy About It	I'm not crazy about this product. It's nowhere near as good as the horchata I get at my favorite Mexican restaurants. I think it lacks flavor; it definitely needs more cinnamon. Also, it's quite sweet. It should be poured over a large glass of ice to water it down. I still do enjoy this product somewhat, especially after adding more cinnamon. It's just not ideal, especially because the extra cinnamon doesn't incorporate well. I think I'm going to try blending it with ice and extra cinnamon to see how it turns out.	1	1
1	B000KV61FC	A1PY4Y72MEDCCG	Keeps my pup busy	It took my 4 month old Westie a week to figure out how this toy worked, but now he can get most of the kibble out in about 10 mins. It is a great toy and it definitely keeps his attention.  The one I have has an actual rope and not a rubber rope, so it has lasted. He has managed to chew off a few of the spikes on the rubber ball. Some end up on the floor and some in his tummy. I think the toy might be better if it didn't even have the spikes on it, so I wouldn't have to worry about him eating them. Overall it is a great toy and the jug seems very durable.	0	0
1	B002SW7ZOW	A3H15E995IH56	Found at the dollar store	I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea, but for the price it can't be beat. Bags are never as good as loose leaf.  I use it if I want one quick cup.  I steep my loose leaf tea 2-3 times, so I have to have time to drink 2-3 cups.  I gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store. If I make myself a mug, and because it is cheap, I use 2 bags.  I would have been disappointed if I had paid the original price on here for it though.	4	1

-1	B002LANN56	A2OR4QUQSUMOW7	My dog looks like me with my favorite ice cream while eathing this.	I loved watching my dog eat this food because he did love it and each time he would have eaten far more had I let him do so.  He looked a lot like me when I am sitting in front of a big bowl of my favorite ice cream.  You know the ice cream with all the stuff in it -chocolate, marshmellow and nuts that I should never eat very much of if I want to stay healthy.<br />But back to the dog food! The food looks more moist and appealing than most and the photo on the bag looks great so if the ingredients were not so clearly poor, I think this would be a big seller.  But  because of some really awful sounding ingredients, I doubt I will purchase more.  I will likely go back to the healthier one recommended by the vet, the one that keeps his coat beautiful and keeps him lean and fit.	0	0
-1	B001BCXTGS	AP6ZL52YA27W5	Cats love it -- but I am concerned	"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again."	2	0
-1	B000R4G4TU	A1AEQZM99LO9VA	Strong and Hearty compared to other Jasmine green tea, it's ok	This is not a delicate tea like most jasmine green teas. I prefer it to the other jasmines that I've tried which have been many. I also like the fact that I don't have to play mother hen to this cup of tea and it still tastes good. It has a pleasing smell of jasmine but it's not overpowering like a perfume. I don't like my tea to taste or smell like a perfume. That being said, this still is not my favorite cup of green tea. I much prefer Celestial Seasoning Mandarin Orchard and Salada green tea over this green tea.	0	1

It just doesn't exist. Trader Joe's no longer sells this jerky. They replaced it with a terrible Jerky that really is inedible, so I've resorted to buying this from Amazon. The Gelsons sells a one ounce package for $5 but that is just unreasonable. Lucky, Amazon sells it for much cheaper.	0	0

-1	B005MWAM72	AAWUXA65NDMYM	Just okay.  Use on road trips, but otherwise make your own.	Like most instant oatmeal, this ended up being a lot like baby cereal in texture and way too thin if you don't cut back on the amount of water called for.  One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture.	0	0

1	B00178W9VW	A1GCUAD7CUOJL0	Healthy enjoyment	I have recently discovered dirty martinis. My brother in law is the culprit of leading me astray while away on a cruise. I was later up in Upstate NY and purchased some onions to go along with my latest vice when I noticed they were not salty but very tasty! I am a person who loves sweet things espcially if they are pickled. These were the perfect match for me. Since then, my wife and I have been trying to lose weight. Yes, we are watching our fat intake but have discovered it is the salt added to everything that is killing us all. Look at a regular pearl onion and how much salt is in them, it will blow you away. Oh, and the olives, too. Compare that to these new Tipsy Onions and you'll do what I am doing....One Olive and three Tipsys make a wonderful Martini!!!	0	0

-1	B003VXHGE6	A25SQ33WVST1HV	Not a fan of this blend	"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands."	0	1

-1	B000FI4O90	ALFN9YXC0KXWN	Buggy Garden!	I got this garden for Christmas.  My first round of mixed herbs went pretty well.  However, you need to follow the directions for harvesting.  Some of my plants did not look so good after awhile.  Also, something was eating my basil.  Everyday I would find little bite marks on it.  I did get some nice herbs and enjoyed cooking with them at the beginning.  My garden never really looked like the picture.  I think I harvested a little early and took to much off at first. I decided to try again.<br /><br />My next herb kit is in there right now.  Not doing so well.  Little nats or white flys are everywhere.  They must have come with the plants.  There are a ton of them everywhere.  I tried to spray them with an herbal spray but it killed the nats and and injured the plants.  I rinced them all off but they are stuggling.  I'm going to have to start over again!	11	2

-1	B0002X8HB4	AEB27HZ60NEXG	Tasty but hard to chw	We have a small dog (17 lbs) and she could not get started on these - they were too hard to bite.  Once we cut them in half (which is quite hard to do!) she was able to get at them and then really enjoyed them.  We probably wouldn't buy them again, since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time, and it didn't really work for that.  Either she couldn't eat it at all, or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half.	2	0

1	B0005YWH2U	A3HRBWBN7DH9XV	All-Round Star	Having been born and raised in south Texas with most of my family from south Louisiana, I grew up in the company of hot sauces.  Now, in my fifties, I tend to use them as my family has for generations: as an accompaniment for different dishes, as well as a mixer in certain other recipes.<br /><br />I didn't discover Frank's until around 25 years ago, as it doesn't come from the South.  However, I fell in love with it on first taste, and it has been in my kitchens ever since.  The unique ingredient that Frank's has is its infusion of garlic.  Not strong, but there.  The motto that this sauce adds flavor and not just heat is quite accurate.  I like spice in and on foods, but my measure for hot sauces is whether I can put some in a spoon and taste it without having to rush for a glass of cold milk.  Frank's passes this test; in fact, I've been known to take a nip when I'm just wanting a taste in my mouth!  It seems to be much better distributed in this part of the world than when it was done by Durkee's.  Hard to say whether it's my favorite, as they are all different.  I don't buy the tiny bottle or the huge one; the in-between is the right size for mine.  Just great stuff, and not overpriced like some others.	0	1
-1	B00622CYW2	A201C2I05EYL86	Not a hit	Our 7 month old really did not like any of combinations included in this variety pack. This may be specific to our baby, but it seemed to be a texture issue. Even if he seemed to like the taste-- he made himself gag trying to get it out of his mouth and didn't want to swallow it. He seems to be sensitive to texture anyway, so maybe this just wasn't a good choice for him. He does like the Earth's Best fruit variety pack, but any of the fruits mixed with grains were a definite no go. The nanny and I both even tried thinning down the mixture with breast milk or formula, and he still did not like it and spit it out. I would recommend trying one jar before you buy the variety pack because I had to give these away.	1	2

1	B000EPOC1Y	A37CENQP0ZNKVE	Crunchy Little Cookie - Delicious	My order for Mi-Del Ginger Snaps arrived a few hours ago and I tried my first one ... okay, I'm on my 10th cookie now.  My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA	1	0
1	B006Q7YFLQ	AA8F2HV4DPV2T	Good for an occasional treat!	My dogs LOVE these and so has every foster dog that we have given it to.  These are a treat not a replacement for a meal.  They are full of great ingredients and none of the bad stuff.  They have a high protein and fat content but you shouldn't be giving your dogs 10 a day.  Honestly, we have dogs that range from 35-60 pounds and they only get a 1/2 a cookie at a time.  My husband is a veterinarian and he was impressed by the quality of the ingredients.  They are a great treat and we will definitely buy again.	0	0

-1	B000ROR8QS	A3CKZFENAT0PTO	Caution, Not as High Quality as they would lead you to believe.	I was very excited when my local store started carrying this product. I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)	1	1

1	B003XUJ564	A2C9XE9I8RSKNX	Pretty good flavor !  Great price !	After reading all of the dented can reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I did get 3 dented cans out of the 12- one was a mild ding, one was fair, and one was such that if I'd been picking it out at the grocery store, I would have looked for a different one- I just ate that one first.  Oddly, they were cans that came from the MIDDLE of the case- so something that happened at the manufacturer- NOT Amazon.  The cardboard tray was unscathed.  ConAgra needs to  do a quality control check on their can dinging area.<br /><br />Anyway, the flavor is pretty good. The first bite wasn't impressive, but since I'm on a fixed income, I only throw away stuff that is about to make me hurl, so I kept eating it.  It got better, and I am glad I got the product.  There were 7 ravioli in the whole can. That is a bit skimpy, but since it was going to be the only thing I had, I ate the whole can and was quite satisfied.  The sauce is much more flavorful than the Chef-Boyardee regular beef ravioli that I had as a kid, and tastes more Italian.<br /><br />The WHOLE can has 480 calories, 10 gms of fat, 78 gms of carbs, and 18 gms of protein.  There are also 10 gms of fiber in the whole can.  The serving size says that  the can is about 2 servings.  Hmm.... maybe for a young kid, or if there was a good salad, and fruit on the side, but I have too much pain to make full meals.  I have to make do.  There are 1 1/2 cups of vegetables per can- so that's good.<br /><br />No preservatives or MSG.  Unfortunately, it probably contains GMO sources of soy and wheat.<br /><br />I originally got these to have on hand for power outages, as I have a gas oven and could heat this up.  The expiration date is for 2 years from now, so that's good.  I can keep them in the pantry for such occasions, but can also see being fine with eating them on days when it's just too hard to come up with anything else.	4	0

He broke the rubber/gel molding in a few places within minutes such that he easily removed the included treat part.  I had stuck carrots, hotdogs, etc, in the ""trap"" center of the ball which gave him a little bit of a project.  Thus it seems to work okay as a puzzle for a little while.  However, I would bet this ""trap"" will only last a couple more uses as he seems to be able to break the product.<br /><br />I was hoping for a ""puzzle"" product to add variety to the kong he loves.

-1	B001AHJ2FQ	A24N79JNVNFSBV	Average Chip...	"Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly ""olive"" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of ""crunch"".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store."	0	0

1	B005GRCWDU	A24DOLZ0TJ06YH	Mmmm, Lavazza	I first tasted and loved Lavazza espresso during time in Italy, where it's popularly consumed. The rich aroma and full flavor are a delight, and I don't find it overly acidic (it's certainly MUCH easier on my stomach than American-style drip coffee, and this from someone with strong stomach and a love of all kinds of drip coffees). I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen. Mmmm, Lavazza.	1	0
1	B001ELL9X6	A298O68DGTCC48	Great deal on great tea	"My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."	9	0

If you get in the mood for muffins, or have company but no eggs &/or oil, all you need for this is add water and shake ( however it is hard to get the last 1/8  cup out of 'jar'/'can' so may want to pour the dry mix in a bowl first if you want every little bit oh the mix) the n pour into muffin tins or maker.

Also, I use it on every type of meat, chicken, pork, steak and seafood. It is the only dry rub I will use for steak!	4	0
-1	B002EDGZB4	A3K7SYF8DZLZMI	Taffy cookies are NOT the same!	"How dissappointing. I have fond memories of the Taffy cookies from my late grandmother and her always full cookie jars.  Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these ""New"" Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible, but if you are labeling them as ""TAFFY"" cookies, they are definitely not a resurrection of the late greats :("	0	3

-1	B001LGGH54	A1I25F9S8ZR6ET	Not what I expected	I thought this would be an interesting drink, but it tasted too much like a Jolly Rancher candy. It's very sweet, and the 8.3 oz can contains 140 calories. Everything is natural in this beverage, and yet it somehow didn't taste natural to me. I think this is due to its sweetness. If you like a sweeter beverage, you might like this product much more than I did. I was thinking the flavor would have been more subtle, but this was pretty assertive for my tastes.	7	4

-1	B005EX6MUU	A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J	Tastes OK but olives had pit fragments & one package had moldy olives!	The taste of these olives is OK. They taste like Greek olives and are a bit soft. Unfortunately, I think they are far too greasy & oily. The oil does not taste like a high quality olive oil. Moreover, the first package had a large number of pits fragments that were small enough not to be seen but large enough to damage teeth and dental work. Overall, 2 stars for my first bagged serving.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my experience with these olives took a turn for the worse. Upon opening the second bag, I noticed that there was white residue and spots all over the olives - a picture is posted. I'm guessing it's mold. It could be due to a package that was never fully or properly sealed, or it could be due to the manner in which Amazon stored them, or perhaps a combination of the two. Regardless, it's simply unacceptable to open a food product and find it in this condition. I would give it 0 stars now if I could.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, I don't recommend this product. I previously tried the green olives from this brand, which were great, but I won't be repurchasing anything from the the Cat Cora by Gaea brand again because of this experience - that includes previous purchases of olive oils, green olives and tapenades. Moreover, this is the second time I've received moldy, white-spotted olives from Amazon. The last time it was the Byzantine brand, and I hoped switching brands would rectify the problem. Unfortunately it didn't, so this is also my last olive purchase from Amazon.	0	0

-1	B000GJ3JUS	A3GP9DVUBXLC86	Nice flavors, not so fresh	Maybe I'm used to the individually wrapped fruit slices, but this bag of loose ones didn't scream freshness to me.

I would strongly suggest a ziploc bag for storage, with any traces of air sucked out of it.	0	0

-1	B00112ILZM	A2TN9C5E4A0I3F	Not sold on this.	"I gave 3 stars for  some good ingredients but this does absolutely nothing for me.  My daily vitamin does more.  I think it's the caffeine.  I guzzle caffeine daily  (yes, I know it's bad for me and I'm not going into why I do that..) so if that was what was spiking people's energy then no wonder I feel nothing.  I was hoping to find something that helped me with a more natural energy but this isn't it.<br /><br />Those of you that are thrilled with it's energy-giving properties, do you think it's the caffeine?  Are you used to drinking caffeine?  If not, that could be why you feel so excited about this..  NO healthy drink powder should contain caffeine.  There is no reason for it! I'm trying to get off caffeine and bought this not knowing it was there.  Stupid me but shame on the company for passing this off as a ""superfood"" then throwing that in."	3	4
-1	B001HWWL6Q	A10Q5WUG5FN1D3	Disliked taste	I ordered these as an alternative to Timothy's Chai Tea. I did not like the flavor & much prefer chai tea made from black tea than green tea.

-1	B000CBOR60	A26J3JRMEZF9VG	horrible	I bought this tea at an Asian market here in town. the box looks the same but the tea was horrible. It doesn't look like little green balls of tea leaves, it looks almost black. No tight little balls, the leaves expanded a little bit when in the water, there are tons of stems just thrown in there.  It looks like shredded little leaves and stems. The tea turned out yellowish brown. I can stand anything just about anything so this was drinkable, but the quality was terrible. I don't know if this is how the brand always comes or if there was a problem with mine.	0	1
1	B003VN70X8	AQ5JDBXICB18J	Really good stuff !!!!	"I really like this mix. It sure beats the stuffing out of those sugar filled containers at the local grocery store !!! I use a leftover gallon milk jug when I make the iced tea. 1/2 gallon of luke warm water, two packets of mix, shake it up, top off with cold water and toss it in the fridge. It couldn't be any easier !!! Plus it's mostly water that ""they"" keep telling us to drink large quantities every day. I'm still amazed at how little mix it takes for a gallon of tea. Super concentrated stuff !"	0	0
1	B001AJ1ULS	A5L504DA1XL6F	Good deal on a great item!	Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.	0	1

They taste like every other grocery store brand of chocolate. Ghirandelli has much better flavor than these do, & I can pick that up local. If I had to do over, I would have picked something else. The chocolate wasn't bad, just not as good as I thought it would be for the price.	1	2

1	B000H0ZJNG	A2BFABJSGQYGCQ	Our dog loves these	We bought a bag of these after seeing our dog's reaction to the Zuke's Mini Naturals, and he can't get enough.  They are large pieces for a small dog (we have a 6 pound toy poodle), but he doesn't have any trouble with them because they're not stiff.  They are also very easy to break into small pieces with your hands if you're using them for training.  They actually smell good, like beef jerky.  Highly recommended.	8	0

It makes horrible, play-doh-like, tasteless cookies. Oh, and the cookies don't rise, and they burn on the bottom. In addition, the ""flour"" is a strange clay color.<br /><br />I was really disappointed, and could barely eat the cookies. No one else would even touch them.<br /><br />The Betty Crocker mix, on the other hand, is delicious, and I can't make cookies fast enough for everyone.<br /><br />One other thing -- don't be fooled like I was -- the Gluten-Free Pantry mix does *not* come with chocolate chips. The Betty Crocker Mix does."	1	0
-1	B0029XLH4Y	A35R32TA60XD57	Too much of a bite for me.	I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.  If you are looking for a smooth, full bodied coffee, this is NOT it.  If, on the other hand, you want something that is bound to curl your toes in an attempt to wake you up, this will do it.  Not what I look for in coffee though.  I like to be awakened with ease, not a jolt.	1	1

1	B0083QJU72	A2A6SB596ROUZA	This is an affordable Luxury	Living in Nebraska, we can purchase real maple syrup in the store, but I really like supporting family farms directly.  This way, I'm pretty sure that the products I purchase are top quality.  If not, I can go to the producer.  I'm no conniseuer of maple syrup like some people on Amazon are, but I can say this has a great maple flavor, the consistency is a little thinner than store bought, imitation maple syrup, but that stuff has artificial thickeners in it.  Remember, this is tree sap, boiled down to reduce the water and increase the sugar content.  Nothing more nothing less.  This syrup makes you want to lick the plate when you're done with the pancakes.  One note, they need to do something to better protect the black plastic cap on the top of the jug because mine was broken when it came.  The jug is sealed well, so nothing spilled.  Not a big deal, but someone picky might pitch a fit about something trivial. Buy real maple syrup whether from this company or another, you owe it to yourself.	4	0

1	B003E728CE	A2LFUTFQ05MD1A	Great Product!	"We have had a number of cats with medical problems and tried any number of ways to get pills into them.  Pill Pockets are by far the easiest method.<br /><br />Most of our animals have considered Pill Pockets as ""treats"" and readily eaten them.  Our current feline gets three pockets in the morning and three in the evening, so we go through a lot.<br /><br />One suggestion:  if your smaller pet needs to take many meds, buy the pockets designed for capsuls for dogs.  Product pricing seems to be related to the number of ""doses"", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.  We haven't seen a cat yet that would't take that.<br /><br />Summary:  A much better way to give your pet meds than a pill shooter."	0	0

The variety I received was decent, but I was totally unimpressed when I opened the shipping box and found that the coffee assortment was packaged in an unlabeled plain, brown paper bag.  I thought the assortment would at least come in a labeled box of some sort, but the samples were literally stuffed in a bag with the top bunched up like a brown bag lunch.  It literally looked like someone just tossed 24 random coffees in a bag and threw it in a shipping box.  Not the best for gift-giving.  I thought that was pretty tacky, especially for the price.	2	1

-1	B001HWWKW6	A30WPXO5NXEREW	Is the cost justified????	I have been using the Bigelow Green Tea Bags with my Keurig machine.  Bigelow Green Tea Bags provide great taste.

I use the Keurig machine solely to get the hot water to brew the tea.  I have not tried the K-Cup Bigelow Green Tea, but I am wondering if the taste using the K-Cups justifies the much greater cost?  I am giving a 3 rating since I do not think the cost would be justifed to use the K-Cups in comparison the the Bigelow Green Tea Bags.  I welcome feedback from individuals who have tried the Bigelow Green Tea and the Bigelow Green Tea K-Cups.<br />Please read my updated comment.

Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies).

1	B000BPR1AQ	A36VKMFP4DEPKV	picaridin rocks	OK, so picaridin is not as effective as DEET and doesn't last as long. Now that we agree on that, lets look at why I rarely use DEET anymore. DEET is oily, picaridin doesn't leave the oily slime on you. DEET smells bad, picaridin has almost no odor. DEET dissolves plastics, picaridin doesn't. DEET has some issues with toxicity/side effects, picaridin has no such problems. So, while I dread putting on DEET, I don't mind at all when I spray down with picaridin.<br /><br />This product doesn't get 5 stars because I have now found 20% picaridin which is even more effective and lasts longer. I also found it for a better price in a store, so I don't have to wait for this to arrive in the mail (it almost didn't make it in time for my fishing trip.)	6	0

1	B004T345GO	A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y	Among the best capers I have found	"I use capers in many dishes, including a meatless carpaccio, lox with cream cheese and bagels, and various salads and cold dishes (see my customer-supplied image at the top of the page for an example).<br /><br />The problem, and especially in the backwoods of central Florida where I live, is finding high quality capers. There are a few brands that are acceptable to me, but since discovering this brand I am a loyal customer for life.<br /><br />Key qualities of these include an excellent balance of acidity and saltiness (a little bite, but not obtrusive), and, of course, crunchiness. Compared to some other brands I have tried, many of which were very salty and not at all crunchy, this one stands out. And, of course, these are nonpareil grade instead of the gigantic capers that litter many supermarket shelves.<br /><br />If you want a real treat use these with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LM5VFK"">Ortiz Atun Claro: Yellowfin Tuna in Olive Oil (7.8 ounce)</a>, Sliced, vine-ripened tomatoes, red onion, and, optional jalapenos. Drizzle with a high quality extra virgin olive oil and season with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BP3PF4"">Herbes de Provence - Provence Herb 8 oz.</a> ... or a high quality lox with cream cheese on a bagel.

-1	B005NYXE8S	AJWLEZHZ4GZBA	Selection Not Good For Price!!!	By the time I was done reading so many colorful reviews for this product, I purchased it out of curiosity. I like to be as honest as I can in my review of a product. I found that much of what reviewers had to say was indeed true. This is a very steep price to pay for the amount and selection of candy included. I did my best to consider every aspect, but still it came up lacking. Any time we can get a variety to choose from in one package, it is fun. Like a grab bag type of thing. But if the majority of the things in the grab bag are cheap, it takes away from it.<br />  It makes me think about shopping for music c.d.'s with a variety of different artist on it. Yes, the idea is nice, but if the majority of the songs don't sound good, I would much rather skip it!!!	0	0

-1	B0000TNS82	AR8V8Y9VHMTKR	Disappointing	I was looking for a really good special treat coffee - something very dark, but not bitter.  Since I'm limited to decaf only once or twice a week, I want to be sure that what I'm drinking is special.  This really wasn't it.  So far, I've been happiest with Kicking Horse and Starbuck's Sumatra decaf, neither of which, unfortunately, is organic.  My search continues.	0	0

Allergen Information: This product was packed on equipment that also packages products that contain milk, soy, wheat, and tree nuts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was so happy to see ""gluten free,"" I failed to read on to see the allergen statement which indicates the exact opposite of ""gluten free."" I ate these for two days - and paid for it each time - before I realized my mistake in trusting the first indication of ""gluten free.""<br /><br />If you are allergic to gluten or a celiac, DO NOT consume this product.<br /><br />I am very disappointed when businesses don't take these allergies seriously - in this case, by placing two contradictory statements regarding allergens on their packaging, and, of course, emphasizing the one that increases the appeal of the product to a specific group of people vulnerable to allergic reactions. In particular, reactions due to celiac have permanent effects on people's lives and health, including an increased risk of cancer, and a failure to recognize this is blatantly irresponsible and should be prosecuted."	0	2

1	B0041CIR62	A1GB85UEMFD4WZ	great gluten free alternative	My mother must eat a gluten free diet so when I saw this item I was very intrigued. Some gluten free products have an off texture.

1	B001OCKIP0	AIUGKZSJAJGEE	Good for snacking	The granola itself is fairly unsweet but the abundant semi-sweet chocolate chunks provide an overall appropriate sweetness and a chocolate flavor that is not overpowering.

-1	B001EO5U6U	A3MDZ81XJN0SR7	Not Sesame Seed Oil.	Maybe I was incorrect in thinking that this was the Sesame Seed Oil normally used in Oriental cooking. This oil is basically flavorless, like a Canola oil. It makes a decent cooking oil but if you're looking for the flavor of dark Sesame Seed oil, this product isn't it. It simply does NOT have the smoky, nutty flavoring that I was expecting. The couple Oriental dishes I prepared with it lacked the flavor you get when using the dark oil. Not a bad oil, just not what I thought I was buying. If you're looking for a light, flavorless Sesame Oil then this is the one.	10	3
-1	B003T5GD40	ABIXPO6XT4Z79	Misleading	Description says 6 bags per PDQ tray. In fact, it is one bag per PDQ tray. Different product delivered than advertised. Not misleading, but outright deceitful.	3	0
1	B003AYL9NU	A2WQW8Z8TE1WCF	My dog really likes these	My dog really enjoys these and they do not last long. She is not a big chewer, and doesn't like bones, so I wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth. I was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the US. When you get them out of the package they don't look like food, but the dogs don't really mind. They are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen shears if you have a small dog.	0	0

1	B001LG940E	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	A refreshing drink	This Black Cherry flavored drink from The Switch is a refreshing and tasty beverage that beats soda any day of the week.  Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Black Cherry flavor in particular tastes great, although the Starberry Kiwi and Watermelon flavors aren't bad either.  Refreshing, worthwhile, and much healthier than any diet soda or nearly any other carbonated beverage, The Switch is definitely worth trying out if you're looking for something refreshing, healthy, and tasty.	0	1
-1	B000UBD88A	A3E64BBONYMQY3	Guess what's in this bag?	While I like the taste of the blend I received this time, I would be happier if Senseo offered a generic bean, such as Columbian Supremo instead of an unidentifiable blend. By offering a blend, Senseo can change the mix to reflect their current costs for the various Columbian beans. The next time I purchase this, if I do, it could have an entirely differant taste.	1	0
1	B002TMV3GC	A3W4D8XOGLWUN5	Hazelnut-astic	There is no question about the fact that I honestly adore a nice and simple tasting cup of coffee to start my day. But Melitta has not been a great company that produces the best coffee filters, but they've also got some really strong coffee flavors to call their own. That comes with their cafe collection, and their Hazelnut Creme Brulee. The taste is absolutely very smooth and mild to the taste buds, yet remain sophisticated and strong from the first time you simply whiff the smell and aroma. I absolutely loved the taste of it from the very first sip. I absolutely recommend this as another delightful flavor in your morning cup of joy in the morning. Melitta does do their best, and they still know how to delight anyone with coffee.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+	0	0

-1	B000DT7QE6	A1HZ2L7F2W75I4	Poison	This product contains propylene glycol and BHA which is poisonous to dogs. Look it up. We threw away a $20.00 bag of pup peroni tonight. Our dog began having seizures after we started a training class with her where they recommended using pup peroni. We used the pup peroni as a training treat as recommend. Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again. In researching this, we found there is a link between pup peroni (propylene glycol) and seizures. Poisoning....Buyer beware.	2	0

-1	B005BPVE3G	A2M1MNG7G40V85	Strange taste and undesirable consistency	I have enjoyed other Eat. Think. Smile. products but I can't recommend these granola bars. The fruit berries have a somewhat dirty taste and combined with their natural CocoaOne flavoring don't jive well.  The combination of the two just doesn't work.  The other problem is that these are crunchy but instead almost have a gummy consistency which just doesn't work in solid bar form.	1	0

-1	B0038B1EOY	A3R7HR0EK89C72	Good Breakfast Option	After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous about how this product would taste, but I found that when mixed with fruit and ice in the food processor it wasn't so bad. That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism. Overall, I like this shake as an option for breakfast it provides nutrients without weighing me down and tends to make me want to eat throughout the day, which is good for me because otherwise I wouldn't.	1	0
-1	B001EO5R7W	A3L7Y6L4GUAFJX	Just ok	This Earl Grey tea is just ok.  The bergamont flavor is muted and dull which caught me by surprise.  I was expecting better from this product as it is marketed and packaged as high end.  Also, the tea leaves are broken and not full leaves.	0	0
1	B004SRH2B6	AA5C0W51O2DIV	33.8 better than 11.2	the liter 33.8 oz containers, which are from Thailand coconuts, taste the best. the ones in the 11.2 oz containers, which are from Brazil coconuts, have an odd after taste. although the brazil ones arent bad, they just are not as good as the thailand ones provided from ZICO, atleast.	31	3
-1	B0026KPDG8	A1B2UXUU1H9CPT	Not so good	After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree.

1	B004391DK0	A2E4D2N8MJW3VG	Best Gluten Free mix ever!	I love this Bisquick Mix!  Over the past 10 years, since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant, I have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad I ended up feeling like I might as well be eating the box!  This Bisquick mix is by far the best I have found for making scones (plain or sweet) and biscuits!  The Orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones I have made were delicious. It was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, I found I can play around with this and don't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  Of course, you can't roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  I have found that if I don't make it too sticky, I can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. I have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza (be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan - I use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesn't stick). Bisquick Mix is made by the Betty Crocker company and this, along with the Betty Crocker cakes and brownie mixes, allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again!  I have Bisquick Mix on Subscribe and Save, which makes it very affordable and makes sure that I don't ever run out!	0	0
-1	B007JFXWRC	A2263F1WASP2PG	Astringent and Sour	I have been drinking Lipton's tea since I was a child but as an adult I have expanded my horizons and have been drinking many other brands.  I'm not sure if this fact has influenced my palate or not but I found this tea unpalatable.  First of all I love the idea of the Pyramid.  Teas that have this shape of tea bag always release their essence much faster and more fully.  So, I really enjoy the shape because of this function and the shape is also esthetically pleasing.<br />The color of the tea in the cup is beautiful.  It is a rich purple color and the aroma of the tea is quite nice.  You can smell the fruit and that hint of vanilla.  However, I had about 3 or 4 swallows and that was enough for me.  I found the tea harsh, astringent, and really on the sour side.  If you have ever gotten berries that are sour (just not ripe enough), that is the taste of this tea.  For that reason I just could not drink it.  It is a great idea but when I have tea I am looking for something mellow and smooth.  While I do love my full caffeine teas (I often drink Tazo Chi), I do like a nice caffeine free herbal especially at night.  One of my favorites is Twinnings Honeybush, Mandarin, and Orange.  Now that is one smooth and flavorful herbal tea.<br /><br />I really like the idea of mixing blackberry with vanilla but this tea just do not sit well on my palate.	4	2
1	B000J423MK	A3N32658GR6XLV	Delicious Replacement for Toddler Formula	My two-year-old LOVES Nido! She is beyond formula but doesn't seem to like milk (2% or whole), so this is the perfect alternative. Toddler formulas are so expensive. Nido gives her the extra vitamins and nutrients she needs, and I get way more value for my money. I used to buy the Nido 1+ Probiotic until it became too pricey for me. The Nido 1+ is a bit sweeter than this regular Nido, so I was a bit anxious my daughter wouldn't like this. She didn't seem to notice one bit--good thing, too, because the price is awesome (esp. if you do Subscribe & Save). One can lasts me about 2-3 weeks. The one minor drawback I notice is that without the probiotic added (there seems to be more iron in this one), she gets 'bound up' more. However, as long as she eats her yogurt every day, it's not a big issue but something I thought I would mention for your little ones who may not eat live cultures/yogurt products (if so, then the Probiotic Nido is the one you would want). I hope this helps other moms and dads (I hear adults like it, too, but I'm not a milk drinker so I wouldn't know [the powder itself tastes yummy though]). It's a fantastic product in my opinion. Thanks!!!	1	0

The fact is you would never know because there was no nutrition information on the package.....my vet told me and she told me me dogs were obese.  The ""Get Naked"" treats clearly list the caloric information, and if you reward one chew treat a day, it isn't a huge addition of calories for your pet.<br /><br />They can be a bit pricey and I do shop around to find the best prices.....Oh, and my dogs love them too~"	5	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A3CTXFPNJCCUVO	My Favorite K-Cup	My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.<br /><br />Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!	2	0

1	B00061EOHI	AWAB7PKBO3BBT	Great tasting microwave popcorn - finally	I am a bit surprised to be writing such a high recommendation for microwave popcorn. I did not have too much of an expectation.  The popcorn is very flavorful and not overly greasy, buttery or salty.  The kernels pop a very bright fluffy white.  I also noticed that the design and material of the bag is quite different and this probably played a part in preventing the burning that I had experienced in so many other brands of microwave popcorn.  I also did not get a large number of unpopped kernels.  There were some partially popped kernels - but those are my favorite b/c they are so crunchy.	2	0

They seem to like the Sardines best, but I'm sure that every cat is different, and Tiki Cat has so many varities you're sure to find one your cat likes.

I don't think I'll be able to even give this nasty stuff away.  I'm really kind of angry that I paid this much for what I thought would be regular, delicious licorice.  It's not hard or stale, just has a horrible waxy type feel and flavor.  Maybe I can save it by melting it all together, adding a wick, and making candles out of it?  At least the color is pretty.	0	0
-1	B0026KPDG8	ABSFFH7ECSE49	Lacks flavor	Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag.	0	2

-1	B001BCVY4W	A1MKS4PE04FC3Q	sesame awesome and chicken pot water	"The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up."	1	0
-1	B0036B8B0Q	A23O76VG1Q1AK9	The only twisted thing here is that they are making money off of this	I bought these looking for a healthy alternative to fruit roll-up type snacks, and they are insomuch that healthy means they dont poison you, however they have nothing to offer more than a heaping 15g of sugar (half a soft drink), more or less the same taste for each flavor, little to no nutritional value (being mostly apple juice), and all that at $.66 a piece. Not a big deal given that there are no real alternatives, except wait, they taste exactly like prunes, which have 10x less sugar, alot of nutritional value, and cost about a 1/3 of the price of this pathetic attempt of pushing empty sugar on kids under the guide of being healthy organic food.<br /><br />Clif Co. stooped to the level of major corporations and attempted to manipulate its customers through deceptive marketing practices. They have certainly lost my business.	4	3
-1	B0017I1Q9I	A4JQCUZ9GOLYR	Watered Down Salsa - Not Worth Buying At All	I just got this 3-jar set today and tried the salsa. I was excited because I had been reading reviews from other Amazon buyers that said the salsa was excellent! Normally, Amazon's reviewers are quite accurate in their recommendations but this time they were just flat out wrong. The salsa is very watery - right away as you tip the jar back and forth, the salsa runs around very quickly and I was suspicious that it would not have enough chunky goodness that makes a salsa tasty. I was absolutely right. The salsa has a thin watered down flavor. There is a muted spiciness that is not worth spending money for. The fire-roasted detail was worthless - it just meant that you would see black flakes from the grilled vegetables swimming around in the watered down salsa. You can get a better salsa at any supermarket - just tip the jar around to make sure that its contents move slowly and look for salsa that markets itself as having won awards at salsa fairs or by chefs. Even boring Pace makes a better salsa than Arriba!	0	3

It's ok, but Plum Organics and Happy Baby pouches are much better for travel because you can squeeze it directly into your baby's mouth.  Sprout still requires a spoon.  So, if you're buying for travel convenience, (unless these flavors are the only ones your kid will eat), there are better options.	0	0

1	B0069AA4Q0	A37HUQ6I3QNZDW	Kobe Beef Is Avalable In the USA!!!!!	"KOBE (AKA) Wagyu ('' Wagy'?, literally Japanese cow) refers to several breeds of cattle genetically predisposed to intense marbling and to producing a high percentage of oleaginous unsaturated fat. The meat from wagyu cattle is known worldwide for its marbling characteristics, increased eating quality through a naturally enhanced flavor, tenderness and juiciness, and a high market value. In several areas of Japan, beef is shipped with area names. Some examples are Kobe, Mishima, Matsusaka, 'mi, and Sanda beef. Highly prized for their rich flavor, these cattle produce arguably the finest beef in the world. These different breeds produce beef that range from expensive (by any measure) to extremely expensive (about US$ 50 per 150 grams of filet steak sold retail in Japan).[citation needed]<br /><br />Wagyu cattle's genetic predisposition yields a beef that contains a higher percentage of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids[1] than typical beef. The increased marbling also improves the ratio of monounsaturated fats to saturated fats.<br /><br />United States<br /><br />In the United States, Japanese Wagyu cattle were bred with Angus cattle to create a crossbred animal that would be more able to survive the U.S. climate and ranching methods. The meat of this crossbreed was more marketable to the typical American buyer, for whom the meat of the wagyu cow is ""too white"".[5] The meat of the crossbreed provides the balance of marbling and red meat desired by them. This crossbreed has been named American Style Kobe Beef.[6]<br /><br />Designed to mimic the diet that Japanese cattle were receiving, Wagyu cattle in the United States are fed a mixture of corn, alfalfa, barley and wheat straw.<br /><br />As of 2007, the U.S. cannot ship wagyu beef to Japan, as Japan requires that beef imported from the U.S. be from cattle not older than 20 months; U.S. Wagyu cattle are usually slaughtered at 30-35 months.[7]<br /><br />In Colorado Wagyu beef is being marketed by a ranch near Basalt, Colorado, and the Angus crossbred by a ranch near Rush, Colorado. Wagyu were first competitively exhibited at the National Western Stock Show in 2012.["	4	2
1	B000G6RYNE	A1S8ELUE383P8E	Ridiculously Good	"I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC"">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control."	0	0
-1	B0040PSERM	A1NB9O4XCLEDGH	Sodium content extremely high!	I bought these beans and the same size can of organic black beans from Westbrae Naturals for about the same price. Libby's says it serves 3.5 servings of 1/2 cup each while Westbrae serves 3 (1/2 cup each). This is significant because it allows Libby's to s-t-r-e-t-c-h the truth a bit in sodium levels. Westbrae's Sodium 140mg (6% per serving). Libby's Sodium level get this! 440mg (18% per serving). I have found these unnecessary high sodium levels on all of Libby's canned products including their canned organic green beans which I will not feed to my toddler anymore. Unfortunately when something sits in this salty solution it soaks up the sodium- therefore you can't just rinse it off. Libby's could make this healthier, gain more customers, AND save some money on the manufacturing of this product if they reduced the sodium.	11	1
1	B004565GV8	A2XNOB1T796Y6B	Very yummy!	So far I've tried all of the flavors and while there are some I'm not over the hill about, I've had pretty good experiences with them.<br /><br />This is one of the flavors I'd purchase again. I'm a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored, so I had to give this a try. I'll admit up front that I haven't had a key lime pie for years, so I don't remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general, though.)<br /><br />This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there, but it's backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey, it's 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldn't want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesn't last nearly long enough.<br /><br />I'll absolutely buy this again, despite the flavor only lasting 1-2 minutes.	1	1

-1	B002QWHJOU	AHL0TI6H9FALR	"The Ultimate Consumer ""Fraud."""	We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price.	7	18

-1	B002C50X1M	A1DTQYJG91K12I	Too many rotten chips!	I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!	0	1
-1	B001AC57NM	A8EUH01IVAWME	Worst cooking experience of my adulthood	I have major problems cooking these on my iron griddle. Although the box says to cook them on a non-stick surface, my well-seasoned, greased iron surface has had no problems releasing food until now (plus it is free of teflon!). I've tried cooking the pancakes three times now. The first day I made the mix I added berries and extra almond milk because the batter seemed too thick. I ended up with burnt, partially cooked gloop and a very messy iron griddle. The second day I tried to match the directions on the box as carefully as possible, and added extra oil to the griddle. The pancakes turned out better, but still stuck to the cooking surface. What seemed to help the most was keeping the heat very low. This morning I tried making them again, with results similiar to the second batch. I will not use this brand again, because I prefer to add berries to my pancakes, and it takes way too long to scrape the burnt bits off my iron griddle!<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, these have a sweet vanilla note without being cloying (which I liked), but they taste strongly of baking powder. They remind me in flavor and texture of mochi, so I suspect that the white rice flour on the ingredient list is a sticky rice flour.<br /><br />All in all, I've had much better luck with other pancake mixes!	1	0

Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.

Having eaten (and re-eaten) my way though all of the DAS caramel range, this remains my all-time favorite, and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them (which isn't an easy thing to do - just try one and you'll see what I mean).  I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didn't put salt in hers, this is an improvement).	0	0

Also sold at Whole Foods for about $1 less per quart, but the free shipping and convenience of delivery plus guarantee of availability from Amazon on this item vs. the gallons of gas my car would require to get to WF give Amazon the edge.

The 2 grams of fat version is the latest version and what you will get from Amazon.<br /><br />On top of being a little less tasty, the 2 grams of fat version gives you 1 gram extra of fat (2 grams per serving, with a total of two servings per package).<br /><br />Another animal cracker this is better than Austin's, but more expensive, is Keebler's Elfin Crackers (almost one dollar a bag and an entire bag contains 5 grams of fat). Both Elfin and Austin use a very mild lemon flavor.	1	0
-1	B000FFLTD2	A2V0R35XFIJUGV	Ehh...	"I was underwhelmed by this soup. I purchased it based on reviews I had read in the book ""21-Day Weight Loss,"" with hopes that it would be a tasty and quick vegan lunch on days when my time is limited. I found it to be very salty and not tasty whatsoever. I forced myself to eat about half of one of the cups and threw the rest away. Now I'm left with five more cups that I will most likely be donating somewhere. It's possible that Pad Thai is the only gross one of Dr. McDougal's soups, but I don't think I will be taking my chances with any of the other flavors offered."	1	0
1	B000I6625I	ATJB7106UIEZD	Shipping flawed	I ordered two cases, 8 each, of the Oregon Red Tart Cherries. When I received the package, the two cases were in a large box with no packing at all. When I examined the cans, only four did not have any dents and four were badly dented. It did not appear that any of the cans seal had been broken, but it will be impossible to open the cans on the top. The cherries in the can I have used were very good.	1	2

So far, I have only tried the orange-mango flavor, but I also ordered the strawberry kiwi, seeing as I love this one so much!  To top it off, the shipping on this was extremely fast!	0	1
-1	B000261NZ8	A1E5D7WTJH9DZZ	Isn't for Our Pup	Well, when we got our dog Valentine as a Valentine's Day Surprise, the next day we rushed to PETCO and they told us that a healthy food would be Wellness and Blue. We got Blue dry food and Wellness canned food. Our dog ate Wellness for a month and a half, and them she didn't really want to eat it anymore, sniff and walk away. The same thing happened with Wellness treats. If your dog would eat anything I would recommend this, but if your dog is a picky eater, you should have other foods as a back up option. We ended up giving the food and treats to our neighbor and owner of Valentine's brother, and that dog will eat ANYTHING, so at least the food didn't go to waste.	0	2

It was less than half the store price, these funny cups use less plastic but still work in the machine and they were delivered very quickly. The coffee is a little stronger, I think since there is a filter bottom instead of just 1 hole so more coffee seeps out. I just run the machine cup-less for hot water and dilute it myself.	0	0

1	B001EQ55RW	A3CG6YLYZJXQG4	Yum!	As  a dedicated chocolate and almond lover this is exactly the sort of thing that would appeal to me.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The fresh, crisp almonds are beautifully complimented by their coating of cocoa.  They're lightly sweet, too.  Just enough to give you the full flavor of both chocolate and nut.  The only problem I have with them is that they're sweetened with sucralose, which is an artificial sweetener, and which may or may not be good for us.  There doesn't appear to be a great deal of it in the mix -- it's the last listed ingredient -- but for some it might be a problem.<br /><br />As with the Marcona almonds I tried earlier, these nuts have persuaded me to think of Emerald as a better brand than I originally thought.  They have some interesting offerings, and the quality of the ones I've tried has been consistently high.<br /><br />If the flavor combination appeals to you, and you don't mind a bit of sucralose, then by all means give  these nuts a try.	0	0

1	B000CQIDHE	AQXJM6TILVEDY	A loyal drinker (!) for years	"Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect ""unwinding"" drink before bedtime.  Not ""spicy"" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea."	0	0

-1	B007RTR9DS	A2WN1QF8GSVHYV	Messy to use. Like the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil much better	"I tried both this & the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil in the squirt bottle. The liquid in the squirt bottle worked far better on my hair, was FAR less messy & easier to apply.<br /><br />This product seemed to feel heavier & weighted down my hair much more, giving it a ""just out of the pool"" look... shiny, but weighted down.<br /><br />If you use this, use VERY little! Although it's hard to do unless you let it warm up & liquefy a bit before using, then you might as well get the lighter, liquid, easier to control formula.<br /><br />Might be OK for an occasional VERY deep treatment, although mayonnaise or oils that you'd eat cost less & are far less messy out of a squirt bottle, which the other product has.<br /><br />Would likely be better for people with thicker strand, very curly hair (afro-american or similar), yet too heavy for my hair.<br /><br />1st two (2) ingredients are petro products, so not my favorite treatment. Has some great ingredients, yet are further down the ingredient list, meaning there is less of them. The liquid hair oil has mineral oil as the 1st ingredient as well, but works well.<br /><br />If you want real natural oils for your hair, I'd suggest food or USP-grade plant oils, such as avocado, sunflower, shea, cocoa butter, palm ""oil""(one of my favorites-the semi-solid kind seems to work best on my hair, yet everyone's hair is different,and has different needs, so try different ones out until you find what works best for you) & similar oils/plant materials (some are hard & need to be warmed to use.) Add some vitamin E oil (natural is d-alpha, dl-alpha is made in a lab) & honey can help (& smells nice) as well, although I wouldn't leave it in your hair - give it a good rinse.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to grab quick that does a great job & don't mind the mineral oil, have dry, thinner hair that breaks easy, I'd get the squirt bottle instead here http://www.amazon.com/CLEAR-SCALP-BEAUTY-THERAPY-Nourishing/dp/B007RTR9G0/ref=pd_sbs_bt_1 It works great & is far easier to use.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this for once in a while deep treatment, but for a couple of times a week,this is probably best reserved for afro-american hair & even then, use sparingly."	0	0

1	B000F4H5FY	A3NVB6HKMUH2NM	Actually the tea was two 5 Star, one 4 Star and one 1 Star	"Let me preface this with a brief history of my tea addiction:  Until I was approximately 40ish I thought all tea came with ice and enough sugar to make it into the infamous ""brown kool-aid"".  Since I only drank tea at restaurants and my Mom's at obligatory dinners, no big deal.  Well as I slipped towards 50 I began to drink more coffee (which I liked) but which eventually led to a parting of ways due to the fact that the coffees I liked, did not return the favor and feeling slightly nauseous was not the desired effect I was looking to achieve.  One day a friend of mine suggested I try some quality tea (which meant nothing made by Tetley/Liptons/etc).  I tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN2F"">Tazo Passion Tea, 24 Tea Bags</a> and while good it was missing that elusive element combination of good taste and adequate energy boost.  So I stumbled into this item <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FY"">Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which gave me 4 choices (great idea).  So without any additional ramblings are my opinions:  English Breakfast Tea = 5 Star, this stuff is great  /  Irish Breakfast Tea = Again 5 Stars, maybe a infinitesimal edge over the English version / Earl Grey = 4 Stars, good taste and flavor, not as good as the breakfast teas (IMHO) but probably better for later in the evening  / Lady Grey = WTF??  This stuff was horrible, I tried to use 1 bag of it with 2 bags of the others to keep from pitching it into the trash but to no avail, I am gonna give it to someone who has no taste buds.  1 Star.<br /><br />Again, realize I am far from a connoisseur of fine tea but I know what I like and what I don't, I am going to buy a few boxes of the breakfast teas and enjoy them.  BTW I also bought a huge box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE"">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a> and to prove my tastes are obviously out of the norm I hated it (I wanted to love it but alas it has something added to it that sure ain't tea)"	1	0

It was very good mixed with some mashed potatoes though.<br /><br />Overall, as a once in awhile thing it would probably be fine, but 12 was too many for us."	1	0

No need to bring along a bigger container, or pre-mix bottles and hope they don't go bad before I feed the baby.

-1	B0075JTH7Q	A3HQN0AQ0XXNUC	Didn't work for me	This product did not work for me. I live in New Orleans and purchased this product with the intent of increasing my electrolyte intake during/following my Crossfit workouts. We workout in a renovated warehouse w/o AC, so it's hot and I lose TONS of liquid/electrolytes daily.<br /><br />I think that there are a few reasons that this product did not work for me.<br />1) I was using it for Crossfit, not bike riding. The advertisement of this product mainly states that it's for riders.<br />2) I eat about 90% paleo. There is simply way too much sugar in this product for my body. It literally made me exhausted because my body was spending so much energy digesting the sugar.<br /><br />So, I am not sure whether or not this is a good product. I have friends who love it who ride for triathlons and Iron Man events. A few of them use a more natural product called Nun (noon: not sure of the correct spelling), which they say is amazing. All I can tell you is that if you're like me and don't take in a lot of processed sugar...ever... this will send your body out of whack.	0	1

-1	B000F4DKBC	A3R1NY5HBYS8XU	(used to be) the Best Chai, period.	"My wife is Indian and loves Chai tea, but we're busy people and it takes a long time to make it properly. She has tried the following:<br /><br />  1. Starbucks Chai Latte (from Starbucks)<br />  2. Starbucks Chai (concentrate, the cardboard box with the syrup in it)<br />  3. Trader Joe's Spiced Chai (powder)<br />  4. Oregon Chai (powder and liquid)<br />  5. Some other Chai powder that Costco had a few years ago but I don't remember the name now.<br /><br />Except for #1 (which is crazy expensive at >$[...] a cup), the rest have been lackluster. But then she found Twinings Indian Spiced Chai Tea which is exactly what she was looking for, but you can't find it in every grocery store.<br /><br />Follow the instructions (1/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup water, 2 tsp sugar, tea bag) and you'll make a perfect cup every time, at like 1/20th the price of Starbucks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now that they have changed the product from ""Indian Spiced Chai"" to just ""Chai"", it is nowhere as good.  I have to reduce my 5 star rating to 3.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Here's her new favorite: Yogi Chai Rooibos, also available from Amazon."	19	2

-1	B002XH57HO	A2A8IY4GTR7GWQ	A different variant of the same spice by MDH	Usually, I love MDH spices. I think they make better spices than anybody else on the market. So, naturally, I bought this Pack of 10 Jal Jeera Masala without having a second thought hoping it would be the same, if not better, than the one I already used to own (which was also actually made by the same company, MDH). Bad decision.<br /><br />This version of their Jal Jeera masala , for the worse, tastes quite different. It has a more bitter taste, and a stronger odor. The ingredients are the same in both packages, so I believe the percentages of the contents must be off.<br /><br />Since no images were available when I bought this pack, I have uploaded the picture of the product you will be getting. Compare that with the one that I actually like which is this one:<br />[...]	0	0

1	B00817GPWQ	A3PVMP81ZG0S7B	Darn Good Coffee	I've always been so so on coffee. I love flavored drinks and I like the IDEA of flavored coffees. But the reality never measured up to the hype for me. But this coffee is really good. It smells fantastic when it's brewing and the taste is spot on. Obviously to bring out the flavor you need to add sweeteners because both the main flavors in this are sweet. But whether I use cream and sugar or White Chocolate Raspberry creamer (my favorite way) it's a good cup of coffee. I have had this in the morning as well as for a dessert coffee. If you like flavored coffees that aren't either watery or overwhelmingly strong, you'll like this one.	1	0
1	B000084E6V	AS2P0PSAT3B1F	Doggie loves her Dinosaur	My dogs LOVE Nylabone products, and they are both aggresstive chewers. This dinosaur is durable, and neither of my dogs have been able to destroy it so far. The only complaint I have is that the tail and the head are very small and pointed (the Stegasaurus is the one that came) which my dogs might be able to break off if they chew hard enough. Overall, I think it's a great toy, and as long as my dogs are happy so am I!	0	0

It cooks in 15 minutes at 425 degrees in the oven, which is the quickest oven meal I've made.  Shake 'n Bake makes the pork crispy and stays pretty crispy as a left over.

-1	B0009PJRMS	AELGD2RFCBG2O	Olivella Bar	Since I, like most people, suffer from dry skin in the winter, I decided to try an olive soap.  It does leave your skin squeeky clean with no soap scum residue.  The bar last a long time too. However, I still feel like I need to apply a moisturizer after.  I was hoping to eliminate that need. I may try Olivella's moisturizer.<br /><br />I would recommend this soap but you may want to consider adding the moisturizer to your cart too!	1	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A3VJ27010XUWTF	OK, but needs to be cheaper!	My husband loves French Roast and does have trouble with acid after drinking coffee. This would be a great benefit to him but the cost would prevent us from buying it.<br /><br />The flavor was still too strong for me but then I like really light coffees. I tried it first without creamer and didn't like the taste. I added 1/3 cup of water as I usually do for any coffee and some sugar free French Vanilla Creamer. Then it was fine for me.<br /><br />I think we would buy it if it was sold at a cheaper price. Kudos for the company for making low acid coffee though.	0	0

1	B001ELL364	AYWUB7U79ECQA	Remember to contact Amazon if unhappy	"I just got my first ""subscription"" order for this item.  I set it up for every 6 months.  The items that came only had a 5-month expiration period from my order date.  I simply contacted Amazon.com to let them know I would expect to have at least a 6-month period based on my use needs and, just like that, they are trying to resolve the issue with a replacement, at no charge, and say they will refund it all if the freshness issue remains.  With the amazing cost savings with this product from them and no s/h fees with a subscription refill and the fact that they are standing behind the quality of it with no back and forth ""arguing"" or excuse making, I have to give a 5 star rating.  This kind of service is so hard to find anymore.  I recommend using them to get this, especially if, like me, there are no stores willing to stock it or, if they do, they charge 3-5x the price noted here."	9	0
-1	B000OF9IPE	A3HXT4P8NFA3KC	Drinkable, not great	This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.	0	0
1	B000NVBVIQ	A2OWCRT7FZEC6Q	Favorite Treat	My Boston Terrier LOVES these.  He can be asleep in the upstairs bedroom and come running if he even hears me even touch the bag!  They are smelly, but totally worth it because he loves them so much.  He is normally picky about treats because he is so spoiled, and I make him so many homemade ones (milkbones? he won't put the things in his mouth), but he cannot get enough of these.  It is a plus that they are made in America and healthier for him than other treats.  My boyfriends family also has two Dachshunds and they go insane over these as well.  Also, my roommate's Shihpoo goes crazy when he smells them.	0	0

I was planning on using it for some desserts I was making to cater a wedding...it arrived and the boxes were old and puffed and the sprinkles inside were white with age. It wasn't the packaging, it looked like they'd been shipped out that way. Nothing like the picture on the front. In fact they didn't even look like they had EVER looked like the picture on the front. Beside the white crappy look of them they were short and fat, not the elegant chocolate sprinkles I wanted. They didn't even taste good. I had a few king arthur sprinkles that I made stretch for my event and from now on will only be ordering them from now on.	2	4

-1	B0032AM8HI	A1NBERVA9EAYHW	Want to love	I really wanted to love this tea but unfortunately I didn't. This Amazon deal is a great price for the sampler pack and three boxes it a great starting point.<br /><br />I've struggled with a lot of morning sickness and only in that past two weeks (I'm now 22 weeks) has it really decreased.  I've lost weight and been on meds to combat the vomitting.  I was really hoping the Morning Wellness Tea would help but alas it didn't and within 30 min of drinking every cup I would vomit it; I tried it at variouss times of the day, sometimes when I felt nauseous and other times when I didn't.  The worst part though was how much it burned coming back up.  The positive - it did taste good!  The Peaceful Mama Tea settled a bit better and I probably only vomitted about half of that and it also tasted good. However, I didn't feel any of the calming benefits.  By far the best tea in this sampler was the Heartburn Tea.  It tasted good and did decrease the heartburn!  I never vomitted it (amazingly enough).  Being that I am not in my third trimester yet I haven't tried the third trimester tea yet.<br /><br />I had truly hoped that the Morning Wellness Tea would've helped because various reviews on Amazon and Mama's Angel site had just been amazing so I wanted to share my different experience.	1	0

I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to ""clean"" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own."	0	0

-1	B005HG9ET0	AYOMAHLWRQHUG	Good Water But I'm Not Convinced it's Worth the Price	According to the Mayo Clinic, insufficient research exists to support manufacturer claims of any health benefits from drinking alkaline water.  Furthermore, the Mayo Clinic also disputes claims that bottled water is superior to tap water.<br /><br />That being said, I drink bottled water because I prefer carbonated to flat water.  So taste certainly has an influence on what kind of water to drink and any water is preferable to soft drinks.<br /><br />I couldn't detect any difference in the taste but my daughter and grandson (both with ADD) could.  They preferred the clean taste of Essentia to our well water but didn't find it to be significantly better than our filtered tap water.<br /><br />If the claimed benefits are scientifically to be true, then it may be worth the purchase price.  But individual testimony (anecdotal evidence) isn't enough to convince me.	0	0

1	B007Z5VNLI	A5O4BU663WWN4	Excellent and versitile tea	"I've been drinking Yellow Label Tea since the 80's. This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular ""brisk lipton"" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the ""Lipton Yellow Label"" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of ""Pure Ceylon,"" a box of ""Coarse Black Tea"" packed in Mumbai, and another ""new bright & rich"" Mumbai variety which is a blend of ""Assam teas."" These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour."	18	0

1	B0002UDY9W	AGGDI4VWPPZ6J	Comforting as vegetable soup, without the veggies	Live with digestive problems, and you eat a lot of mint: mint lozenges, mint tea, and those 'curiously strong' mints.  You can get tired of the taste of mint.  Especially in the morning.  I gave up coffee months ago, (and I still whimper some mornings), so I'm looking for some kind of substitute.  Forget decaf anything.  Forget chocolate.  Forget tea.  Some people swear by hot water with lemon. I don't. Too acid.  This fennel tea sells elsewhere as 'tummy tamer tea.' It does.  It's better than chamomile tea, which doesn't do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything.<br /><br />I've used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in.  When even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much, this goes down nicely.  But if you're not a fan of vegetable soup or celery, this might take a little getting used to. Me, I like it. The smell reminds me of hops.	1	0

Which, by absolute definition is TRANS FAT.<br /><br />I strongly suggest everyone educate themselves on how this modified fatty acid is destroying your health, and the food companies know it.  It's specifically designed to prevent oil from turning rancid, by preventing oxidation of the fatty acid.<br /><br />In my opinion, the hydrogenation of oil will result in law suits that overshadow the tobacco industry suits.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'll look for a better alternative for this product."	0	0

I thought these tasted okay, but I wouldn't buy them instead of any of the traditional flavors. They were a nice, soft texture yet still satisfyingly chewy (without endangering dental work). I do like the fact that they are made from ingredients I can pronounce and recognize-- they actually have pomegranate in them!

There are no ""off-tastes"" - really there is not much taste - period.<br /><br />I'm afraid bland says it all. To call this dish ""Mexican"" seems terribly wrong. Rather customers should think of it as a fast cooking rice with a hint of tomato and a hint of red pepper.<br /><br />At the right price I'd recommend these Lipton/Knorr side dishes.

Since I work from home, I don't hit the coffee shops, I need to get my fix from the kitchen. He's also started bringing a travel mug to work instead of stopping off at a shop, so we find it's necessary to buy coffee we REALLY like. I was thrilled to try this and it didn't disappointed.<br /><br />I expected something like the usual vanilla flavored coffee. But this was more subtle and natural tasting. It was a startling surprise from what I'm used to when buying flavored coffees. There was nothing fake or overly sweet about it. Boyfriend also said he liked it a lot, which I didn't expect since he's not really a flavored coffee kinda person. Delicious coffee, and I look forward to trying the other fusion flavors.	0	1

So now, we mashed, somewhat, an avocado in the Ratatouille and he would inhale it down in no time!

-1	B000WV153I	A3BVJTMD6XUC5J	No safety seal and loose lid upon arrival	Well I was really excited about this coconut butter but when I received it the product was in a small box inside a larger box with some padding. When I opened up the larger box and pulled out the smaller box it was saturated with oil on at least 70% of the box. I opened it up and the product was VERY seperated and the oil had leaked out onto everything! The jar was so oily I could barely hold it without it slipping. Anyway i washed it off and opened it to find that there was not only not an air tight seal (obvious by the leaking) but there no no safety seal under the lid like most products have....Anyway I called up Amazon and they gave me a refund. The product once mixed well seemed like it would be pretty good and had a nice smell. However I'm scared to use it at this point...did everyone else have a safety seal on theirs?	1	0

I typically pick them up at the local BB&B ($10.99 for 8 servings about $1.37/cup, and just now found out that they have free shipping :))<br /><br />My issue here is with this specific item.  It lists ""Includes 2 packs of 16 servings each!"" which would make the price of $32.99 a decent deal for 32 servings ($1.03 per cup).  I guess thats the benefit of buying in bulk.<br /><br />But then, the package arrived this morning.  In the package is two 8 serving packs.  Now, it is important to note that with any Tassimo Lattes, there are two T-Disks needed for each serving.  1 is the milk and the other is the espresso or tea.  So there are 16 T-Disks in each package but only 8 servings.  Everywhere else on the planet, it will cost you between $1.00 and $1.37 per serving.  Here, it will cost you twice that much.  Total false advertising and complete ripoff.  Guess I'm going to find out how Amazon's return policy works."	0	0

1	B000V6FU08	A2KBFB6A2D7PNO	Great tasting chili - convenient and microwavable.	This is a great-tasting chili, but as the name implies, is quite hot and spicy.  There are two servings in each microwavable container.  I divide it and get two separate meals for myself.  Very good taste for a packaged chili product.  If you like hot chili - you will probably enjoy Campbell's Chunky Firehouse.	3	1
-1	B007RTR9G0	A1P77JG6PMRRPK	Deep conditioning	I used this product a couple of times and am not thrilled with it. I don't see it as something to use every time you shampoo, just when your hair is dry and needs deep conditioning. I have short, fine hair with natural curl, and I found that this product weighed my hair down. It might be more suitable for someone with long, thick hair. The second time I used it, I wound up shampooing my hair lightly afterward to get rid of the sticky texture. As other reviewers have noted, there were no instructions with this product, so I'm not sure how it is to be used -- before shampooing, after shampooing, after conditioning and so forth. I have been pleased with the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo and conditioner, but this one doesn't work for me.	1	1

-1	B0046HDZRI	AKETQI0G103Z7	TAKE THESE OFF THE MARKET!	These are horrible little things that need to be removed from the market IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY.  I put one in my mouth and was in ABSOLUTE AGONY with the horrendous pain in my entire mouth and jaws! It lasted for about ten minutes, and I was gasping, crying, moaning and shaking uncontrollably the entire time. I simply could not believe it! I've had oral surgery along with surgery on my hand and both elbows, and even with that I never experienced such horrible pain. For that matter, I recently fell and broke my collarbone, which was rather painful, but even that pain was nothing like what I experienced with these stupid mints. I was truly frightened. Thankfully I was at home when it happened because if I had been out in public somewhere, people would have thought I was dying. I was unable to talk and could never have explained what was wrong with me. Do a Web search and you'll see that other people have also had problems with these terrible, noxious things.  Consume them at your own risk!	0	1

-1	B000T2CXCM	A2R1J8BV8FBASC	Digit Apple Wraps	I tried this product once. My dogs loved them. Just found out they are made in China, where everything is inferior. They are also made dirt cheap. But the price of 3 bags pushing $50 is what put me over the top. One of my dogs is Newfie, so 3 bags is a snack. I don't like this buying from China and being charged a quality 'Made In America' price. It's a dog treat for pete's sake. I guess my babies will have to do w/o this poor quality high priced item.	1	0
1	B000B6KQZM	A17HMM1M7T9PJ1	A staple in my spice cabinet	First I should state that I don't make pumpkin pies.  I am really not a dessert kind of guy, I leave that up to others.  However, I love this blend and use it all of the time.  My favorite would be for French Toast, I add a little to the egg and milk mixture and then sprinkle some on the finished product.  It also goes well with sweet potatoes, yams, Cinnamon rolls, peanut butter (just try it before you cast stones), carrots and many other savory dishes that could use a little bit of flavor.<br /><br />The combination of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice adds an extra dimension to many foods. I often make my own version from freshly ground ingredients but this brand is fine for when you want to add a lot of flavor in a hurry.	2	1
-1	B001E50U32	A2GC2NFP7JFW3F	great for snacking	Ordered these, as our toddler loves the graduates puffs. She drinks juice normally, but just didnt take on these juice treats.

-1	B002GWMA08	A3HP0OJ5MWTATS	Good Flavor but dry beans	"My reason for the low rating is that there was no ""use by"" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness."	3	1
-1	B000FFRY5O	A2RZN0J3924CX2	please watch out!	I just received these pretzels but have not tasted them yet because I noticed under the ingredients on the package that it says may contain traces of sesame or poppy seeds.

-1	B0001CXRMK	A3R42FQH0PEYEG	Stick with the original...	I love Guayaki's original, but I'm not a huge fan of the chai spice mate.  I bought it, because I love chai and I love mate...not a great combination.  Something about the sweeter kick with this one doesn't work for me.  I usually drink two cups per tea bag, and the second one goes down a lot smoother.  Maybe I just need to dilute the first a bit mote.	2	1

-1	B005PANYEY	AMB1ULLQHU4YJ	Terrible new version of what was a good product	"It is always a huge disappointment when a product that you have relied on for years destroys its merits in search of a new image. Cytomax has ruined a good product with the ""remake"" it has imposed on its product line. It is now made with an artificial sweetener (Stevia) and has a quite different taste and different nutritional values. I will not buy this new version."	1	0
1	B000F6SLM8	A2HU9J8XAVJZ3N	Excellent!	This snack is superb in several ways.  First it is very good tasting.  The flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie.  Nutritionally, it has quite a bit of protein, very very low in simple carbohydrates (or sugars) and is high in fiber.<br /><br />I carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine.<br /><br />These would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip.	1	0
-1	B001E5E268	A1BOXR5OPYYWWJ	Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.	I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.	0	1

I was not happy with the flavor or the way it didn't dissolve easily. However this crystal light version is so much better. The flavor is not exactly like the Snapple but it is very pleasant and it dissolves perfectly. I actually use more water to mix it than suggested just to stretch it out a little but it still has a good flavor."	1	0
-1	B001942GAI	AFVHFU48J1ORY	Tasty but not much of a snack	These are an absolutely delicious snack, however I found them to be so lightweight that I can eat an entire box in one sitting.

This stuff isn't the most ""natural"" chicken bouillon, but it does taste like chicken, at least to me. It lets me do some dishes which might be salt content prohibitive were I using the traditional bouillon. On the whole, it's a good product if you must cut your salt. If not, there's nothing wrong with the taste, but I'd probably be trying to go for products with more actual chicken in the ingredients. I do use low sodium chicken broth as well."	2	0
-1	B007I7Z3Z0	A3DH53FPYSP9E	A tangy water enhancer but hardly tea	"We drink a multitude of beverages in our house.  Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new beverages a try.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix is a blend of tea, honey and strawberry acai that comes in a 10-Count box with each powdered package producing a 16 ounce drink.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Easy to make, just add water, stir/shake and you're done.<br /><br />+ Convenient for travel.<br /><br />+ Good way to add flavor to water.<br /><br />+ 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  One packet makes a 16 ounce serving.<br /><br />+ No aspartame.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Contains sucralose.<br /><br />- Doesn't really taste like tea.  Tasted more like strawberry Kool-Aid or Jell-O to me.<br /><br />- May be a bit too sweet for some.<br /><br />Powdered ""On-The-Go"" drink mixes always seem to be hit or miss in our house.  Most of the time they taste terribly artificial or too tart/sweet for our tastes.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix was no exception.  It tasted very little like any flavored tea I've ever tried.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a sweet and refreshing drink.  However, I think many people will have difficulty equating the flavor of this drink mix with tea."	2	0

Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.

I have always bought whatever store tuna was on sale.  When we started trying to be a little more conscience about the products we were buying and the company producing those products, I stopped buying tuna.  I had seen this tuna before, but didn't want to spend 3-4 bucks on a small can.  I found this large can and decided to try it.  We are a family of 4, but have kids in sports who love to eat, so I don't think we will have any problem finishing this.  I will take a couple of portions and freeze them to be used later.

"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them."	1	1

-1	B000HJPBGC	A3GI3JVPGM49GE	Weak coffee	I am disappointed. When I first bought this coffee last year it had a nice mild and slightly hearty taste. This past batch is much too mild with no body.	0	0
-1	B006HYLW32	A37JB1DGWBIDDS	Gross!	I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.	7	6
-1	B004DABQ2Y	A1ZSXNOU5YZ7AL	Great food, wrong picture	The picture for this product is the 14 pound bag.  However, this product is a 4 pound bag.  Easy to tell you are buying a 4 pound bag when you are on a computer, but not a mobile device.  So I was very surprised when I received a the 4 pound bag.	0	0
1	B002NHYQAS	A38BE06WWL20AY	Great, but even darker might be better for my taste	Very goo bar but a little sweet for my taste... I like my chocolate even darker. I compared it with similar bar from Trader Joe's with the same 54% cocoa, although the Trader Joe's bar is a huge one pounder. The Newman's bar was slightly smoother, perhaps just a little more waxy and sweeter. Big plus for Newman's Own is that it is organic and rainforest alliance certified.  Next, I'll need to move up to the next level of dark from Newman's Own. Maybe that will be the perfect bar for me. I know I like the Trader Joe's 70% bar better than this one but the darker version of Newman's Own might be even better.	0	0
1	B003ZS4FXM	A3CNFWUUPE8AUM	It's Yoo Hoo	"""The name literally beckons.""  If you have had Yoo Hoo before, this is it.  If you haven't, it's basically slightly watered down chocolate milk.  I haven't had it in ages and thought I'd share some with my family.  I don't happen to be the biggest fan, but it isn't gross or anything."	1	2
-1	B001E5DZSY	A18OKW70N0HL0P	Good But Not Great	The taste of this popcorn is superb; however, the dark kernels do not fully pop for us.  We are using a hot air popper and are still trying to figure out if we are doing something wrong.  We have separated the popcorn into two batches; one that has the dark kernels removed and one with the dark kernels remaining.  Of the two, the fist batch without the dark kernels is superior, but we are still experimenting with the dark kernels.  We have not tried another brand or type of popcorn yet, but will do so in the future.	6	0
-1	B004EKQM4U	A3S8BDPVGJNH9C	LIARS!!!!  This is not raw cacao!	"If you've ever had raw cacao nibs, you should realize immediately that these nibs are roasted.  I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they ""roast"" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that ""all cacao nibs have to be roasted...""  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products."	6	0

-1	B006BXV130	A240JPZ4EINMDJ	BLECH!	Kellogg's Krave cereal tastes like chemicals to me. It contains ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab by inserting foreign genes into their DNA and made them resistant to massive amounts of RoundUp. The sugar in Krave comes from GMO sugar beet, and the soy is GMO soy. I called Kellogg about a month ago to ask if they are using genetically engineered ingredients and they said they do use them because the FDA says they are safe and Kellogg's complies with the FDA regulations. I called Kellogg's again yesterday (twice) and this time they told me that they don't know if their products contain GMOs because they don't test for them. Kellogg has pumped $632,500 into the propaganda campaign in California that is fighting to trick people not to vote for Prop. 37, for the labeling of genetically engineered foods.  Kellogg's doesn't want you to know that Krave contains GMOs. My family thinks they taste disgusting anyway. Poured the box down the toilet. We won't be eating Krave again. Blech!	5	1
-1	B007OT22LU	A1ZTEE4XWDD285	These are okay, but it's not a Snickers Bar	They are good, but there is no nougat and the caramel is really soft and runny. Doesn't taste like a Snickers bar.	0	0
1	B006H34CUS	A20YR57D0WDT5D	Nom nom nom	It says on the packaging that it tastes great when heated in the oven. And I believe it. It's pretty much a healthier banana nut muffin but in a square. Now, the bar was a little dry when I tried it but probably because it was sitting in the hot car for a few hours before I ate it. But I'm sure with a glass of milk, this would be a real treat.

-1	B00176CTRS	A24DJO0LNB3RJD	Little Bitz for your Little Ones	I picked up these when the local pet store stopped carrying the thin bone shaped Little Bitz chicken and rawhide chews. The Beefeaters Little Bitz Small Round Chips are circular wafers of rawhide backing with a hard dried meaty topping. I was reluctant about getting these because they are about 1/4 of an inch thick though they don't seem to be more than an inch in diameter, and well I wasn't sure if it would be too big for my teacup's bite. My picky pooch seems to do ok with them though sometimes the cracking sounds she makes scares her but she cant get enough of these. I prefer the similar product by Beefeaters that are thinner less chunky. These are great for smaller breeds. But be warned they give my dog terrible gas. Only recommend these if you really love your fur babies and won't mind the smell.	1	0

1	B001XVW3DC	A25UXBNDYXJ26S	AMAZING finishing salt-Great price	Maldon is my go-to salt for finishing at the table. Perfectly delicate and crunchy, it's an elegant addition to any table. Do't worry too much about the price, because this will last you a good long time. You only use it for finishing at the table, not for cooking (cheaper kosher is the this for that), so you only use a pinch at a time.<br /><br />I get it locally from Whole Foods which, ironically, has a really good price; for folks who don't live near a store that carries Maldon, this is a good deal! Enjoy!	3	0
1	B00113HA3A	ATEKXH8FNRPEE	This is really good tea...	I've always bought the Good Earth Lemongrass Green Tea, but I wanted to try something new so I bought this Super Green Tea. The Lemongrass tea is probably the best green tea I've ever had, so naturally I didn't have high expectations going into this tea. After opening the teabag of this Super Green Tea, I knew immediately that I was going to love this tea. You can smell all the aromas of the tea and none of them are overwhelming on the nose. Once brewed, I couldn't stop drinking this tea. Like the Lemongrass tea, each of this tea's flavors are brought out and none of them are overbearing. The orange oil is perfect; not too much nor too little is in the tea. After drinking two cups of this tea, I'm ready to say that this tea has replaced the Good Earth Lemongrass tea as my go to green tea.	2	1

1	B0007PRMUE	A9Z5L0JFXKIU2	This is the stuff!	Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha is one of my favorite packaged teas. It has a rich, strong, and full taste. In comparison, Yamatoyama's genmaicha tastes a little burnt, and other genmaichas seem somewhat diluted. If you like the genmaicha served in Japanese restaurants, you really ought to try Ujinotsuyu's version -- you're going to love this stuff. These tea bags are strong enough for two uses (steepings).<br /><br />I've gone out of my way to purchase this tea. In the New York City metropolitan area, one may also find Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha in ethnic Japanese, Korean, and Chinese supermarkets, although searching may be required.	7	0

1	B002FYAONM	A12P1OO2TV4SLH	soy microfoam!	I first blamed my cheapo espresso maker for my inability to get nice soft creamy foam out my soy milk. I then upgraded to the rocket cellini, a much nicer and more powerful machine. And Wham! still no microfoam. My wife and I are both vegans so we stuck with non dairy 'milks'. Tried different soy milks, from Silk to Kirkland's. Nothing. We also tried Almond milk, which I read would froth. Well, Froth they did. But it wasn't a soft velvety, wet-paint, microfoam. Well, the soy blenders solves that! It does froth beautifully and it tastes great. Definitely worth trying. That's one less variable to worry about in making that perfect breakfast latte.	1	0
-1	B000RHVFUA	AHK4OBYK2S0SC	Not dried at all well.	"I have now bought these ""dried"" cranberries as well as Traverse Bay's dried cranberries.  This is a 5 pound bag.  Traverse Bay sells a 4 pound box.  The Traverse Bay box is DRASTICALLY larger than this 5 pound bag.  Why?  Because the cranberries from Traverse Bay are DRIED.  These are partially dried and have a nice sticky puddle of cranberry juice in one corner of the bag.  FAIL!  Go buy Traverse Bay's dried cranberries.  They're about the same price and you get drastically more.  I won't be paying for liquid again."	1	0
-1	B007RTR9G0	A2RQOO8VYAEZZG	Smells like suntan lotion, low on shea	"While this product calls itself ""Ultra Shea"" and also notes ""with shea butter"" on the front label, shea is actually the 7th ingredient, after Mineral Oil (#1), Hydrogenated Coconut Oil (hence the suntan lotion smell), Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) oil, and BHT (preservative). So if you're expecting some yummy natural product from the ""ultra shea"" reference, you'll be disappointed. In this case ""ultra"" either means ""a little bit"" or ""mostly petrochemical products but also.""<br /><br />(Notably, the ingredients aren't immediately visible on the bottle--you have to remove the peel-off label to expose them.)<br /><br />But I'm not opposed to synthetic beauty products, so aside from the misleading packaging, I gave it a whirl. It's a pretty standard hair oil: greasy and thick, which is good for heavy damage or use on ends. I'd probably avoid using it on my scalp except as a deep treatment to be shampooed out, because the oil is quite heavy.<br /><br />But the scent is a deal-breaker for me. It's a *heavy* coconut smell that doesn't readily dissipate and leaves you smelling like you should be on a carnival cruise ship. (I love a light coconut scent, especially tempered with citrus  or mint; but this smells like you're all buttered up in a deck chair swilling a pina colada.)<br /><br />I do like the bottle, which has an elmer's glue type lid that lets you dispense a few drops at a time, and seems to be pretty leak-resistant."	2	0
-1	B001EQ5BUI	AG80OSRMJ70J6	Tastes burnt	I did not care for this product at all.  I was expecting more of a Demerara sugar taste and this is WAY more intense.  Tried to use it in iced tea - taste burnt.  PLUS - beware - you can't return it.  It is a grocery item on Amazon and they won't accept returns.  I'd find some somewhere to try before buying these big containers.  I used one cup and hated it and then had to just give it away.	0	1

1	B0049ZCF9G	A1SQPBEUL9VEDR	Delicious and healthy treat!	I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!	0	0
-1	B000HIFANW	A3T0OTH5072YRE	Rice A Roni Rice Pilaf	As much as I'm a fan of cooking everything from scratch, I am definitely not above using a boxed meal every once in awhile.  Sometimes you just don't have the energy or ambition to cook something from scratch, especially rice, which if you don't have a rice cooker, can be time consuming and difficult.  So Rice a Roni products are ok to me, used in moderation.<br /><br />The ingredients, for a boxed meal, aren't terrible.  There is MSG unfortunately and a very high level of sodium.  Which means this probably isn't the best meal for someone with health problems, or for that matter anyone trying to be healthy.  But it does have real onions, rice, and other spices which is ok.  I like that they use turmeric for the coloring since that's supposed to be a pretty good spice for you.  The fat content in this rice box isn't too bad either compared to some of its competitors out there.<br /><br />The cooking process is pretty simple as well.  Even if you use a microwave its just a matter of zapping it a few times to brown the rice and then cooking it with water.  And you only dirty one bowl and one spoon in the process.  It says to cover with something during the actual cooking process and I've found that covering with a towel tends to produce a more tender rice, but that may just be my imagination.  They offer suggestions on how to make this rice a meal by adding chicken and veggies too, although I didn't do that, I instead sauteed some pieces of sausage in a maple mustard and added them to the mix, which actually worked quite well.<br /><br />The rice itself is kind of light flavored.  There's some flavoring sure, kind of chickeny actually.  But its not very strong, and I prefer my meals strong.  The flavor was good, I just wish it was more pronounced.  Adding that aforementioned sausage did help a bit.  The texture was enjoyable.  The rice was just firm enough to get a good bit through it but soft enough to really sink your teeth into.  And it wasn't a mushy mess like these can sometimes turn out to be.<br /><br />I'd probably have this product again.  Its not something I'd make a regular part of my meal, but in a pinch its a good way to fill out dinner.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012	0	0
-1	B000X1Q1G8	A156LB7D9SSF6J	Don't waste your money...	I recently received a half price offer for Walden Farms, buy up to 10 of their products and get up to five free.  The Peanut Spread is one of the items I tried.  While I was not expecting anything like real peanut butter, I was hoping it would be something palatable that I could use for a sandwich or to spread on celery.  IT WAS TERRIBLE tasting nothing like peanut butter and barely tasting of anything peanut related.  The aftertaste was terrible! I tried a bit on a teaspoon and it repeated on me for hours.	1	0
1	B003ZDWMGO	A32V2ZP3EZ39CM	Delicious!	I was unsure about ordering this product because I didn't quite understand what it was. But, after a little nudging from a friend I bought it and I LOVED it. I personally use it as a pizza crust because it is much healthier than the ones you can buy at the store! But I also make it thicker and cube it up for a delicious protein in my salad. The Traditional is most versatile, but also be sure to try the Chili flavor if you like a little spice!	3	0
-1	B0012NUVN0	A29EO071ZXRRQW	Not so great or everlasting as they may seem	I bought one of these (the small size) from a pet store for my 15 lb Jack Russel mix. I was hoping for a toy that would hold together like a kong but was harder to get the treat out of. The first day we had it, it took a while for him to get the treat out but once he got it there was no problem and the plastic started to weaken. This wasn't a big deal because you can stuff the inside with more treats but after a while the plastic started to come apart in little chucks and the toy went from a possible kennel toy to have to be supervised...	0	0
-1	B002LANN56	A3V55DVYU80LDS	Dog's Liked It, But Basically Junkfood	My dogs seemed to like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, but after reading the ingredients, I realize there wasn't much nutrition. Yes, beef is the first ingredient listed, so that's a plus, but it pretty much went downhill from there.<br /><br />I'm not so keen on products such as soybean meal, soy flour, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn.<br /><br />These are cheap additives that do nothing but make BIG POOP because the dogs really don't digest much of these things. With 2 one hundred pound dogs, I'm not crazy about big poop in my yard. Also, corn does really nasty things to some dogs, dry skin, itchy hot spots and outer ear infections. We're sticking to Costco brand dog food, which is much more nutritionally sound.	0	0

I'll probably buy one of their color kits now that I know it's a great brand.<br /><br />The only thing I haven't tried yet is using it to color melted chocolate - I've been told that water-based dyes like this one will make the chocolate crumble.

Not overpowering like some flavored coffees; this one has just a hint of flavor and I think it makes it better.<br /><br />I brought this into work and shared it with colleagues; it quickly became one of our favorite blends. Not bitter at all, yet not weak at all either. A nice, smooth blend perfect for relaxing mornings as well as at work. I will be ordering more.	0	0
-1	B005VOOLXM	A26TWY9AD935HC	Too Weak For My Taste	I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.

-1	B000H27NY2	A4K2OLRGNM6J0	great - but way too salty -increase volume by 50% to make it edible	Have eaten both Minestrone & Vegetable Beef - liked both very much but have just finished making & eating Vegetable beef.  This would be a wonderful soup but it is way, way too salty.  I had to increase the volume by 50%: 4 more cups water, 1/2 bag frozen mixed vegetables, 1/4 bag frozen peas - xtra salt free vegie broth mix (homemade), xtra Mrs Dash.  When I finally got done, the soup was great.  Don't know if I would buy again unless the salt is cut in half (at least).  I am sure the Ministrone must have suffered from the same problem - I don't remember - I do remember my son & I liked it very much - I have been unable to find it at my grocery again, though.  My grocery is WinnCo.  Please lower the salt content - People can always add salt but I have to really change the soup to make it paletable for me.	0	0

I was so happy to get it for her...She was so happy the day it was delivered and has already enjoyed a few bowls full. She says it tastes better if you make it with milk...My one complaint is that it was VERY expensive breakfast cereal when you purchase it  with the shipping costs  plus the cereal . It might be cheaper for us to fly back East where it came from and pick some up in person.	2	0

These treats don't cause any problems and my dogs love them so much that they will do anything for an additional treat: even take a bath.	2	0
-1	B003ZT61E2	A1TR9417Z4U72F	It's alright, but not quite what I wanted...	"I was kind of excited for this Peppermint Mocha MH International Coffee flavor since I'm a pretty big fan of the similarly flavored Starbucks holiday coffee flavor. I tend to use the MHI Coffee powders as flavor enhancers in my daily brew, but for once I wasn't crazy about the flavor. Actually, the first thing I really didn't care for was the ""self-foaming"" aspect to this one, almost as if it has some tiny peppermint-flavored pop rocks in it or something. Not needed and kind of weird to me. Overall the taste is alright, though I feel it needs to be paired with a regular cup of coffee for optimal taste. Just by itself with hot water it's kind of flat."	0	0
-1	B001E5E0D8	A250PPAYI1KS91	back to Caffe Espresso	I was buying Lavazza Caffe Espresso at local vons for 5.99. Now it's 7.99 so I checked amazon. still more than 5.99 so I bought this, cheapest Lavazza for 18.98 with subscription.<br /><br />according to their website, Caffe Espresso is medium, this is dark roast and this has some sweetness.<br /><br />when i opened the package, soon i noticed this has a stronger aroma, a bitter kind. unlike starbucks italian dark roast, it's still brown.<br /><br />i used bialetti moka machine. usually make it latte. i think this is bitterer than Caffe Espresso and I feel some bitterness remains on my tongue. maybe this is more like natural Espresso taste but I prefer Caffe Espresso. and i have one opened pack and three unopened packs left...	1	0

1	B0014WYXQK	AGBRTPPIJT6UK	Yum, yum, yum....and more yum!	I remember when Izze was first introduced a few years back. I had it in Chicago and I immediately fell in love with it. The great packaging and the great taste made me consider it the gourmet version of sparkling water. Now they have done it again ?!  it is hard to believe that anyone can make something great even better, but they did it!<br /><br />The new fortified version is so refreshing that you can drink can after can and not get tired of it. My kids loved it, my girlfriend loved it, my mom loved it. This was a hit at our house. I wish that I had a chance to try the other flavors this was so good. Izze undeniably has a winner on their hands.	1	0
-1	B002GWFA1Y	A25CRHCW00U0WG	Subscribe and Save:  Doesn't Save	"I have purchased Coffee Bean Direct 5 lb coffee in the past and I think it is a good value for the price (slightly above average).  Thinking I'd economize, I recently ordered using ""subscribe and save"".  Unfortunately, the USPS in my area (Maine) has changed it's delivery approach.  The mail carrier does not stop or attempt to deliver a package, but instead leaves a slip requiring me to drive to the post office to claim my package.  With gas at $4 per gallon, any savings is wasted.  It's actually cheaper to use the Amazon Prime delivery as Fed Ex and UPS have no problem actually delivering."	0	2
1	B004JRKEH4	AEY4BDF60KB78	My whole family liked this product.	My whole family liked this product.  It has a smoky chipotle flavor that (when tasted alone) leaves a slight burn on the back of your throat.  We used it on tacos and the sauce gave them a very distinct taste that we all enjoyed (no burn :) ).  My husband is incredibly picky and said he liked it and would eat it again. The Kid thought it would even taste good on a salad.  I'm thinking it might also be good as a marinade.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it the next time you want to add something a bit different to your meal.	0	0
-1	B000KNFBJC	A130946ZKSHV0D	Where are the feves???	Ok, let me start by saying I'm an avid chocoholic and am EXTREMELY picky about the quality of chocolate I consume. I would like to commend Ghirardelli for being the first chocolate company to offer a beautiful fruity, tangy, yet richly rounded chocolate flavor at it's deserved bittersweet cocoa content to the average consumer using the average grocery store. I can even find these at some Targets! I was so impressed and relieved to finally find a useful size of chocolate, with an all-around excellent profile in a truly affordable package! (note to bakers- why pay 4 dollars for a 4 oz baking bar when you can pay 4 dollars for an 11.5 oz bag of the SAME CHOCOLATE)What's more, this chocolate is MUCH better than any expensive Callebaut, Cacao Barry, or Scharffen Berger chocolate at equivalent cacao mass.<br />HOWEVER, Ghirardelli has really disapointed me as of late. I used to use these almost exclusively for the NY Times Jacques Torres Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe, the BEST out there, which requires a specifically large and flat shape in the chocolate chip used (feve). Ghirardelli USED to offer this shape, WITHOUT milk fat, and it was the PERFECT size and shape, and melted beautifully into my ideal chocolate chip cookies. NOW they've made an ugly, NORMAL chip shape that is stiffer when melting and totally RUINS my perfect Jacques Torres cookie dreams.<br />GHIRARDELLI!! WHY ON EARTH DID YOU CHANGE YOUR CHOCOLATE CHIPS???????	0	11
-1	B0002NVLLW	A93LBTV617ZVC	Poor Delivery Method~	Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....	3	1
-1	B002LANN56	A20DDH4NT6Q1E8	Three dogs: two didn't like it, one loved it	Firstly, let me start by saying all three of my dogs love Chef Michael canned food.  So I was surprised that I didn't have a better result with CM dry food.<br /><br />This CM dry dog food looks appealing to the eye (my eye), with what looks like vegetables and 'jerky' meat bits, but there's something about the taste or the smell that doesn't appeal to two of my three dogs.  Admittedly, both those are somewhat fussy eaters.  I was able to coax one of these to eat the dry crunchy bits, but she refused to eat the softer 'meaty' parts paws down.  The third dog seems to enjoy all of it just fine, which is the reason for my 3-star (average) rating.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was that the bag was as large as an 8lb bag of dry kibble, but only half the weight.  I guess all those soft and fluffy meaty bits are to blame for that.<br /><br />Overall, it's hit and miss in our house.  3-average stars.	0	0

-1	B000FA3912	ATDE9JYCPI0L1	Not impressed	Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.	0	0

What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.	0	1
1	B004OLKF60	A2G27AJWU370D	Bold, rich flavor	"This is my favorite brew by far. I have always been a french roast fan because I just love the flavor of coffee. This delivers that bold, rich taste without tasting ""strong."" It's smooth with no hint of bitterness at all. If you love the flavor of coffee, give this a try.<br />However, it's much cheaper at Walmart. I buy 18 K-cups for $13 there. I wouldn't pay the prices here."	0	0

-1	B002YFZ7IY	A2DP4IFQOWELAI	Why?	This is the second bag of Orijen grain-free adult dry dog food I have purchased. The first was gobbled up by my little Papillon.The second bag has caused her to have diarrhea,and throw up. I have smelled the food and it does have a sour odor. My daughter who lives in Austin,Texas buys this food for her dog and has had no problem. She buys locally. There is not a store in Amarillo,Texas which carries this brand. Could something have happened in the shipping of this food to me? The vet put her on Carafate and Amoxi which seem to cure the diarrhea. However, she will not touch the dog food now and I have been giving her Prescription Diet i/d (gastrointestinal health). I am puzzled. The date code is good, and the first bag was fine. I would appreciate any feedback you have on this product.	1	1

Spirals however have a problem in that their centers need more cooking than the rest so to get them cooked well they do become overcooked.  Try fusili instead-they are AWESOME!	9	2
1	B001GE3T1G	A3SIOSO6LTWCVE	Hands Down, Best Mint EVER.	These things are AWESOME. Perfect size, truly wafer thin, consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior. They are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint. I first tried them when I was living in Germany 16 years ago, and to this day no other mint comes close. And the copycat ones? Disgusting. Go for the original. You won't regret it. Each mint is in its own sleeve, so you can pass them out without ever touching one. Elegant and delicious. Love them!	7	0
1	B004LQRQL0	A35080YUZO1CIY	Finally found a way to eat Brazil nuts!	I thought that I didn't care for Brazil Nuts, but a clerk at my health food store talked me into it since I had my heart set on the coconut one. (they've been on back order for a LONG time). She said that she didn't care for Brazil nuts either but that she loved this. Well, after sitting on my counter for 2 weeks thinking that I wouldn't like them, I finally tried them. She was right. These really ARE tasty. However, at over $6 per bag, I won't be purchasing from this particular seller. In fact, it was my understanding that Amazon required competitive pricing? Maybe I'm wrong. But even my hoity toity health food store is selling them for $5.49. I've found them repeatedly at health food stores and even some convenience stores along the freeway; so keep your eye out for them. I'm looking forward to trying other types now that I know I'm in love with the coconut and the Brazil nut ones.	0	0
1	B000PDY3P0	A8QNV14F7U8O4	Dan's Perfect Popcorn	Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.	0	0
1	B001EQ4PTQ	A1051DBTLWP5A2	I don't know exactly why, but my baby goes nuts for these!	I began giving these to my daughter when she was 12 months old.  At that time, she was still having difficulty with many table foods - but she was able to eat these without any issues.  While other fruit strips are usually gummy and tough, these are extremely soft.  Sadly though, they're very expensive and have a lot of packaging waste.  That being said, my toddler REALLY REALLY REALLY loves these.  In the past she loved them so much that she used to cry when she realized she only had a bite or two left.  When she was going through her picky eating stage - these were always a food that she readily accepted.<br /><br />Now that she's approaching 2, I don't buy them very often due to the price.  However, these were a great food to use when transitioning to table foods.	0	0
1	B002Y2QT2K	A38Z6AXXVW5EWR	It's chicory..	I am from the south where I always purchased Luzianne coffee, it is not available where I live now and I was missing that flavor.  I had never brewed it by itself before, but tried it when I recieved this and love it!  It's a nice alternative and great to have a strong tasting beverage that you can drink before bedtime.  It isn't coffee, but if you love chicory blends you might like chicory by itself.  I read a few reviews that were confused because it IS made by a company with coffee in the name.	0	0

-1	B00427ZLOC	A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q	I wish they'd omit the veggies	The texture of this food is like cooled pea soup.  It's not as stiff as some of the pate style foods and my cat likes it.  All but the veggies that is.  So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.	0	0
-1	B000UGXWQ8	A1WTP99BOA0PGA	Buyer beware on taste and shipping	I got a variety of flavors, but for the amount of shipping charged, they could have been better packaged. In addition some of the flavors were great, like root beer, others vile, like the chemical-tasting watermelon.<br />In hot humid weather it is also really hard to get them out of the wrapper. You can put them in the fridge for a while, but unless you are working on craft or cookery projects or run a store, don't buy in bulk in warmer months or if you live in warmer climates.	2	0

This ghee reminded me of my childhood days. The 'milk man' would bring the cow to our door, hand express milk. This milk would then be boiled, the cream saved for buttermilk culture- then churned to extract butter and eventually boiled to make ghee! That is the only way I know authentic ghee can be made and that is exactly how this product tastes!<br />I will come back for more.... and more often!	2	0

1	B000KV61FC	A3CIZKPTSGFF70	This has Haven-and-Coda Australian Shepherd Approval	"I've been looking for this toy forever.  Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes ""how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?""  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo -- may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn."	2	0

I contacted the online store and they refunded the full amount. I also discovered that there was only 5 packs instead of 6. Upon opening the pouch and trying some I found that they are too soft, like hot dogs. If you eat it right after opening the pouch it will seem soft, but if you leave it out for it to dry it then it actually has a bite-teary taste to it. I'd have to give it 2 stars, I docked a star for the expiration, the softness, and the missing pack."	1	1

1	B001SAYKJS	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Very good flavor	I just used these in a beef stew last night and was very pleased with the tomato flavor they added to the stew. The tomatoes themselves are about twice the diameter of grape or cherry tomatoes. My wife just picked them out of the can one by one, mashed each with thumb and forefinger, and dropped them into the stew. Without peels, they cooked down and just became part of the stock.<br /><br />You can buy these with and without basil added. It looks like a couple of people who reviewed here were shipped the SKU with basil by mistake, and instead of handling their problem with customer service, blamed it on the product. Here's what you do if someone ships you the wrong product. Instead of mis-targeting the product, call customer service and tell them to send the right product, and send a shipping label to return the wrong one. If they won't do that, call your credit card company and deny the charge. It is that simple.	3	1

We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again.

-1	B002O5QWD8	A2DPXEK3B5ZOSG	What am I missing?	Everyone seems to enjoy these so I think maybe I'm missing something.  I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(don't laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, don't laugh).<br /><br />If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know. They will be in their resealable package in the pantry until that point or they expire.<br /><br />Thanks.	4	1

Plain Fig Syrup with No Additives	"This is the stuff to buy!<br /><br />I looked up ""Califig""...and that has all sorts of other stuff added: SORBITOL (a sugar), artificial colors, and Sodium Benzoate (which is related to Benzine)<br /><br />If you have digestive issues, I would not put things in my body that will irritate the issue.<br /><br />Ooooo.....Try a ginger, peppermint tea sweetened with fig syrup. That would probably do you really well, if you like the CaliFig.<br /><br />Fig syrup is great for coughs, sore throats, asthma, anemia, catarrh, colitis, gout, and digestive ulcers.<br /><br />I drizzle it over cereal or oatmeal, mix it in with juice....<br />Mix it with milk and it tastes almost like chocolate.<br />yum yum YUM!<br /><br />It is very high in vitamins and minerals..<br />Goolge it!<br /><br />I bought 6 bottles.<br /><br />My kids love it!"	3	1

1	B00020HHRW	A31KEDM3BCYK6D	good stuff	this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks	15	2
1	B0048IH43Q	A3M2JU46KYE61B	Great taste and effect	Really like the taste of this drink, its sort of a lightly sweetened and carbonated ice tea (label says non carbonated, but for some reason it has some small amount of fizz.. or i am just crazy). I never liked the taste of sweet tea or raspberry tea, but this really taste good. Gives me the same amount of energy as a big cup of coffee, minus the heartburn. As for the price, at 24$ a case its the same price as my local grocery store.	0	0

Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry.	1	1
1	B0041NYV8E	A1VBDMNT6I8RE5	...lingering of sheer hotness! :)	"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix<br /><br />If you like your tea Strong and Spicy (with a nice little bite to it), like  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6727O"">Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea, India Spice</a> (for example) then you are going to Love Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix.<br /><br />The product dissolves quickly in a cup and 1/4 of hot water (250ml).  Just enough sweetness without over doing it.  No bitter after taste.  Must be the ginger, but there is a definite lingering of sheer hotness (like a mild cayenne pepper) on the tongue -  that lingers for awhile. :)<br /><br />The lemon is not bitter, caustic tasting or over powering -- just very smooth.  No puckering-up here. :)<br /><br />*I'm thinking this may be just the caffeine free ""pick-me-up"" I need around 2pm, to get me through the day.*<br /><br />Does Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon sound like your kind of Beverage Mix?

-1	B0037QGKSK	A14NA0W8ESGDSI	Talk about that date bar	The bar itself was decent and didn't have many calories associated with it. I generally try to avoid snack foods but this fact made it fairly easy for me to grab one or two of between meals.<br /><br />The taste though was semi decent and nothing special. If you don't like the taste of dates I suggest you avoid. At times it tastes like a neutrograin bar and other times it tastes like dates themselves.<br /><br />I also had, on several occasions, the unfortunate experience of getting some of the bar stuck in a tiny hole in my teeth. It's very hard to remove once it's stuck up there I can assure you.<br /><br />It's a decent bar for a quick snack but nothing too special.	0	1

There is an odd, almost chemical or salt-like  taste to these as soon as one bites into them, and the texture wasn't quite right, either.  It was a big disappointment.  But happily, I soon discovered Walker's licorice toffees at another website.  No artificial colors or preservatives, and no hydrogenated fats either.  Best of all, they're totally delicious, and by far the closest I've come to that marvelous Callard and Bowser taste and texture.  They're are made in England (like the old Callard &Bowser candies)  and are truly wonderful.  They're irresistible.  I just ordered four more bags!<br />i	1	0

-1	B000N6BS8O	AG18YOAT03J34	It's edible, but I would only use it for deep frying....if at all.	Olive oil is a slippery subject....<br /><br />There are LOTS of different types of olive oil, usually differentiated by:<br />Extraction method<br />  Pressing (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)<br />  Cold pressed<br />  Hot pressed<br />  Solvent extraction<br /><br />Pomace is what's left of the pressed olives after the final pressing.<br />Pomace is the lowest grade of oil which is edible (and some pomace is inedible.)<br /><br />Edible doesn't mean tasty. The vast majority of knowledgeable olive oil consumers wouldn't consider eating pomace grade. Generally the worst of the plain olive oils has considerably more flavor than pomace.<br /><br />Where you aren't looking for flavor, then pomace is possibly appropriate, but it should be much cheaper than plain olive oil. It is appropriately used as you would sunflower, corn or other neutral flavored cooking oils.<br /><br />Many in the USA like extra-virgin oil, but most Europeans prefer virgin, as it has more of the olive bitterness. Most in the USA have palates which are trained to dislike anything bitter. Most in the USA have been raised on vegetable oils which have little or no flavor (the advertising  boasts about this fact.)<br /><br />If you want an oil which won't affect the flavor of your food much, then this is an o.k. product.	21	9

While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.	0	0

-1	B001995D6W	A392Q7223C9MUP	Updated: Broken pieces, no returns, but some salvalgable	"I've tried Tiger Tiger's ""Puppodums"" before and enjoyed them. They're fun to nuke, tasty (though not really spicy) and pretty healthy as snacks go. I was psyched to find them on Amazon, especially with a subscribe and save option. Unfortunately I received the first box with each of the 12 packages crumbling around the edges, cracked and broken. If you've tried these before you know this makes them pretty useless. You need the whole 'sheet' to be intact to oil on either side, then bake or nuke. Small pieces are really no use, and large cracked off pieces are a pain. I'm so used to Amazon being great about returns, I was rather shocked to realize (somewhat understandably) food items are on the No Returns list. So I'm stuck with this big box that I'll probably just toss out. And out twenty bucks.<br /><br />Although I get why food can't be returned, given that this is dry packaged imported goods I wish Amazon wouldn't blanket ban returns. In fact, I'll probably think 3 or 4 times before ever ordering a grocery/food item again.<br /><br />Sorry to say I suggest skipping this item. If you receive it as I did, you too will be out a twenty spot with a box of perfectly good useless food to throw away.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/12: As I didn't want to actually throw away this big box of poppodums, I've been slowly working through them. There were a few packages in the middle of the larger box that were unbroken. The broken ones, mostly around the edges, so they've lost 10 - 20%. But I'm still enjoying them. Changed to 3*. Still tasty and a good protein substitute for a starch."	0	1
-1	B0047LRBQY	ABDRSWS8IQ56R	Stale and Poorly packaged	The candy is shown in a sealed zip bag with a label sating what it is. It was shipped in a plain baggy taped shut. My order was for three different types of chocolate covered nuts, all pictured in labeled zip bags. I received three unlabeled sandwich bags without any packing labels or content information. The pecans inside the chocolate were stale. The peanuts are Spanish peanuts with the skins still on them. Who dips Spanish peanuts in chocolate? The skins make them taste bitter. I had intended to give some of them as gifts, but since I had to open each bag to figure out which was which I wasn't going to give an opened bag, especially after tasting them!  I contacted Bayside Candy and requested a refund. The response was to tell me not to rely on what the advertisment showed, but to pay better attention to what their seller page states regarding their bulk products. They also stated they would not give a refund unless I shipped the chocolates back to them.  You are not supposed to send opened food products through the mail.	2	0

1	B002TMV3E4	A1UQBFCERIP7VJ	A good cup of decaf	This Melitta Riviera Sunset decaf makes a better-than-decent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite. I used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker.<br /><br />While I was enjoying the coffee, I read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water. That got my curiosity up so I measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon. Since I use two heaping scoops, that's slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package. Following the directions would probably make a watery, undrinkable brew.<br /><br />The coffee has a nice even espresso grind, perhaps a bit lighter than a French roast. I would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but Melitta states that it is an all-arabica blend from Central and South America. It is decaffeinated through the chemical-free Swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Also note the cute vintage travel poster-style label and the clever name: because it's decaffeinated, it's perfect to drink while watching the sunset.	0	0

We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to.

-1	B002T0NXK8	A3MGFGGDCJQP22	I won't buy it again	The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.	0	1

-1	B006MONQMC	AVZ1SYMD26S4R	I guess its O.K.	The Fruit punch flavor of this water flavoring featuring  Vitamin C  is O.K. though it took quite a bit more product than the instructions called for to give any noticeable fruit punch flavor to the water. I noticed a distinct bitter chemical aftertaste which was not the taste I usually get from vitamin C. I am one of those people who can taste some things that most people can not taste and some of my family members did not find this product bitter and some did. I really like the idea of a water enhancer that includes vitamin C but this particular product was not one I enjoyed enough to continue drinking.	0	0

-1	B000VK8AVK	A3KZ7OH4VRL048	A healthy alternative, but with overpowering and inconsistent flavor	"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."	2	0

When soft and fresh, these are definitely worthy of five stars. I love the green frogs and mini frogs the best. Whenever I am at Cost Plus (the only places I find the mini frog gummies) I'll purchase a small 5 oz bag at $1.79. So when I saw the latest deal through Amazon to get 5 lbs of mini frogs for cheap, I jumped on the deal. Yes, I did read all the reviews and saw the one and two star reviews before placing my order. But most were old posts, some years old. They've got to improve their product freshness issue by now, right? Wrong. Unfortunately, what arrived was a big block of hard, stale mini pellets (gummies). I was totally disappointed. Hence, my one star review.<br />For those of you wanting soft gummies. Buy the 5oz - 12 packs. Those are tightly sealed packs and hold in the freshness better than the non-airtight packaging of the big 5 pounder. Not as good of a deal but you'll be getting a fresher product.<br />Would I buy this product again? 5lb package: no. 5oz 12 pack: yes.	4	0

-1	B000CSEFQ0	A6B8YSM1CZCF6	Who packs these boxes?	This is the first review I have ever written about a product, and I have bought over 300 to 500 items from amazon. I just wonder who packs these boxes? When you advertise a variety pack of 60 with 7 different cereals, one thing that does not come to my mind, is somebody packing the box with what you feel like giving them. Not everybody's favorite cereal is frosted flakes in my case, and or raisin bran for somebody else buying this product. When you spend $56.00 for 7 different kinds of cereal, that's what you think your getting, not what they have more on hand of at the time. There should be an equal distribution of each kind, and if they can not do this please specify this in the product details so consumers are not mislead. Because if I wanted frosted flakes I would go buy a box at the store. The Variety idea is great, but the spending $56.00 for a mystery box of cereal is not. Thanks.	0	0

I prefer jerky on the tender side, so I really enjoyed the original Wild Ride natural style, but I also don't have any hangups about additives, so the new Cowboy Strips line totally blows away the flavor of the bigger brands I'm used to; same tenderness as the organic Wild Ride stuff, but with even more taste.  And if you haven't tried the Pepper yet, you're missing out!	12	1

-1	B0033HGLTG	A3KXF2B579H8OZ	Don't touch it	I purchased two boxes (50 K cups)and out of the 50, 40 of them ended up in the trash can, beside the fact that every time I tryed to brew a cup of coffee, coffee grind was all over the machine and inside the coffee cup, due to the K cup bursting during brewing. I did not have any problem with the same brand of coffee i purchased from my local supermarket though. I will not buy it ever again on line. A real nightmare.	8	4
-1	B000DZDIYC	A2WEMSRPGTRTTS	Unclear labeling	On the original display of Pamelas cookies, Lemon and Pecan Shortbread there was no mention of gluten free.  In the order page in was in very small print that I missed. They were definitely unsatisfactory.  I opened the package to taste so felt that I could not return them.  So I am stuck with 12 boxes.	0	2
1	B0045XE32E	A2O421DTA8J0RW	Very hard, nice breath refresher for big dogs	Ok.... so all the fancy name effort means nothing in the long run. I mean goodness...TEN words in the name alone... for dog biscuits! LOLOLOL However, the nutshell is pretty straightforward. The dogs like them and they have healthy ingredients in them and that is all that really matters to me! The ONLY negative I noticed is that these cookies were really hard - not just crunchy, but HARD and several of my older dogs had some difficulty breaking them down and chewing them. Even so, all the dogs in this house have enjoyed them and the biscuits did improve the Walker Treeing Coon Hound's notoriously disgusting breath issues. I would probably buy these again for the younger dogs and find something less brick like in texture for the elder statesmen in my pack.	0	1
1	B002AYAMIE	A3GGXJD0BMJ2W3	Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!	This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.	18	2

We call them the pepperonis and my puppy gets one on the Bouncy Bone every night before bed to calm him done a bit and he just loves them!! In fact after two nights he really started craving them before bed and asks to get down to our bedroom not to sleep but for his pepperoni!!<br /><br />Doing two at at time can be expensive but one on one side to the bone is just right!!	0	0

-1	B003VMBVQ6	A2MJQGWWSP0IGV	NOT AT ALL LIKE JAPANESE STEAKHOUSE DRESSING!	The consistency is watery, and the taste is extremely sweet.  I assumed it would've tasted just like the dressings from the Japanese Steakhouses.  I only bought this item because of the reviews and I saw it a had 5 star rating on it.  From this experience, I decided not to ever base a purchase on Amazon solely on the reviews or star ratings ever again!  Beware!!	1	1
1	B000F3VB8C	A2M9D9BDHONV3Y	This is DELICIOUS!!	I've tried many Scarpetta products but this one is truly scrumptious!  Some of the other reviews stated that the jars arrived outdated.  I've had that happen to me too.....once before..... and just ended up throwing out the four jars since they were UNDOUBTEDLY spoiled.  Unfortunately I never thought to complain to Amazon and ask for replacements......live and learn.....I knew food could not be returned but replacing bad, outdated food.....I should have realized I could do that!!  However, those were the sauce, not this bruschetta topping.  This topping has a wonderful fresh home-made tomato flavor and the artichokes are whole and delicious.  I ate two of the jars on bagel chips but just used a spoon on the third.  Mmmmmm good!!  The fourth jar I gave as a gift to my uncle.  He did not care for this bruschetta as much as the ones his many friends make for him becaue they use lots and lots of garlic and black olives which he loves much more than artichokes.  This topping is mild but so very flavorful.  If I don't eat it all just by itself, I'll try it on fish or chicken like some of the other reviewers suggested.  It really is a very versatile topping.  I highly recommend it to everyone.	1	0
-1	B004S07G1O	A11IJ39FJ33AGR	Where's the chicken ?	I bought this stew a few days ago because I remebered how good it was when I was a kid, i.e, big chunks of chicken, big carrots and potatoes, and delicious flavor. Sadly this product has changed. There's barely any chicken, the potatoes are very small and sometimes black, and there's not many carrots. Is there a chicken and potato shortage that I don't know about or is Dinty Moore really cheap ?. Also some of the cans were dented, so I contacted Amazon and they sent me replacements, overnight express shipping(Amazon's customer service is the best!); this is before I tried the stew or I would have asked for a refund. Anyway, I am very disspointed and I will not buy this product again.	2	1
-1	B00141OVJA	A3HIFHS6D69YP4	Should Be Zero Stars	"This product is made in China. Although it is distributed by a company in the US, it states ""Made In China."" I see that nowhere listed on the ad to buy it and thinking I was doing my dog a favor, I did him harm; he has been ill for two days, after eating two of these ""treats"" when I received them two days ago. Because the label touts health and wholeness does not mean it is made by people with health in mind. It is made in China. The same nation which put melamine in food; melamine reads as protein in analysis of the food so it was a cheap and shameless method to advertise more protein while it caused misery and tears and death to countless. And this is an item Amazon does not accept as a return so purchase at your own (dog's) risk."	6	5
1	B000VK339Y	A302EYUTYTOTZ0	I feel good about giving my dog this product	My dog is 14 years old with many health problems. He is fussy about his food, but this is one that he will consistently eat. The whole Newman line is known for giving back to society, so I feel good about that as well.	0	0
1	B000UZVPKO	A1JWZ9JOKSKRZN	Amazon sardines good for low sodium dieters	I like this product much better than the canned sardines I am able to find at my local grocery stores.  I buy Rolland and Seasons ( both sold by Amazon ) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture.  It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones, which, along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines.  They work for me.  I have eaten them since I  was a kid - I'll turn 80 in July. Incidentally, my cat is crazy about them too.	2	0
-1	B0090X8IPM	A720S06Y6KV49	Fairly strange taste	I don't know what the odd taste is. It smells lightly of vanilla, and I've never brewed Starbucks at home before, so maybe all their coffee tastes this way, but there is an acrid, almost chemical aftertaste to each mouthful of this. I smell a decent basic medium roast, but I taste burning and something very off. The vanilla is weak, but strong enough to ruin the cup.<br /><br />I got this from the Vines program, and I'd never buy it again. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn't worth the brewing, even if it was free. I've had better results from grocery-store brands that were pre-ground and on the shelf for who knows how long.	2	1

I will try the chocolate one next.	3	0
-1	B0040BDPC0	A3DBGFYV6XRMLV	Made my dogs sick	"I purchased this based on the ""natural"" ingredients and a general thumbs-up from my vet. My first dog got very sick with severe vomiting. Thinking she got into something unrelated to the food, I continued to feed this to my other dog. Within 2 days my other dog got sick as well. The result = 2 sick dogs + a vet bill. The remaining cans went in the trash immediately.  I would NEVER recommend this dog food to anyone."	1	1

-1	B00012PPL6	ACMQTESEAZQON	product not very flavorful	I did not think that the red buffalo chocalate flavored coffee was very flavorful at all. It smells really good, but is definitely lacking in flavor. The coffee tastes good, but it doesn't taste flavored. It is not worth the money.	0	0
-1	B002YL2SAI	AKOJKMHSZYDTO	Disgusting!	"I've been buying gluten free food for awhile now, and these are by far the WORST cookies! There are many cookies, like Pamela's, that make you forget that they're GF. These don't. These are horrible! They don't taste even remotely like chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />If you want some sort of tutti-fruiti cookie with a funky aftertaste, then go ahead and buy these. Otherwise, definitely skip them!<br /><br />*** UPDATE *** I looked at the box again, and the box has an expiration date of ""10Jul18"". I bought them January 12, 2011. Obviously EXPIRED. NASTY!"	0	1
-1	B0028C44Z0	A3BJ9NS09YGQT5	These just don't do it for me as breath mints	To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.	0	3
1	B000121718	A3OBP99ZV5TG6C	The best water ever!	"I really like my bottled waters - and Badoit is at the top, the best by far.  Where most carbonated waters are slightly hard with ""big"" bubbles, Badoit has a much softer feel on the palette and the carbonation is not as overpowering - (smaller bubbles) and the effect is awesome.  Taste is great and the overall experience is highly refreshing.<br /><br />If you have the money to spare, I highly recommend!"	0	0
1	B001E5DZTS	A2WZKMNZG42JQM	meyenberg powdered goat milk	This stuff is fantastic.  My little girl loves it and it gives me the piece of mind knowing that I am not feeding her a huge amount of sugar with mainstream formulas.  Not to mention the other things they have found in them recently.  This is the closest thing to mothers milk.  If your baby spits up a lot you should definitely try this stuff.  My little girl hasn't spit up since I switched ever.  Love it.  Just wish I could buy even more at a time.	0	0
-1	B001D630KW	ASUPCMC7DQMAZ	Blech!	"This isn't at all what I had hoped for. I absolutely love pretty much everything ""pumpkin flavored,"" but this missed the mark. I was hoping for a flavor similar to Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, but this isn't even close and I've honestly produced better flavor just using sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in my latte. I appreciate other coffee shops' pumpkin lattes, so if this had tasted good, I could have gotten over the fact that it was different from Starbucks', but I just plain don't like it. I think the spice is too heavy--I'm not sure exactly what spices were used in creating this, but based on pumpkin dessert recipes I've made it seems like maybe there is too much allspice? I have a feeling this is going to wind up down the kitchen sink drain :/"	3	1
-1	B0078Y6OX8	A314ZA5U4FPODR	Must have gotten a bad batch :(	I must have gotten a bad batch, Both the roast and the cup quality were poor.<br />2/10 cups so far have failed and dumped grounds into my cup.  The roast does smell great though. I like all the other varieties I have tried and I enjoy various flavored coffees, this box though, the flavor came out quite burnt tasting.  I bought it based on the overwhelmingly great reviews.  I will drink it but no one else in the house will touch it.<br />I am not impressed with this brand as there are much better ones listed right h  ere on Amazon.	0	0
1	B007TGDXMK	A203G0307JU0Y4	San Fran k-cup all the blends	Since we have found the San Francisco brand of K-cups for Keurig brewers, we will NEVER go back to the enclosed K-cups.<br />We love ALL the San Francisco blends.  The French Roast is perfect for a bolder cup, it also seems to be the only one in Decaf which my husband uses...I like either the Rainforest or Breakfast Blend for a softer cup in the evening.<br />We live above 7,000 feet elevation in Colorado and had trouble with the enclosed cups because of the pressure created inside so we had to puncture the tops with a toothpick before placing them in the machine, otherwise the grounds would shoot up into the water spout and cause it to clog up...<br />With the mesh type cup of the San Francisco brand, this never happens and I have noticed there is no more coffee ground residue to be cleaned out of the cup area either.<br />I only put a few at a time in the 'coffee basket' each day and keep the rest in their package, folded and clipped to keep them semi airtight..<br />We LOVE them all and they have solved any of the functional problems we occasionally had with the brewer.	1	0
-1	B00122DL10	A165S6NPL5O86X	A litt too big for Senseo	These are OK, but not great.  I'm not super impressed with the flavor.

1	B0013THC2Q	A1ARVQSBZNM6UW	Perfect tast for Kona Blend	Boyer's Kona blend is the best tasting coffee I could have bought, I get the whole bean to preserve freshness, I think when you buy ground coffee it tends to sour if you don't use it quick enough. So i get whole bean coffee so i can grind and use the coffee as i see fit and still get a quality taste of this coffee. Its worth trying if you like Kona Blend coffees.	0	0
-1	B001GE8N4Y	A2N3ZGV6UDL7C	A bit disappointed	After reading all the rave reviews about Nielsen-Massey vanilla, I purchased the 32 oz. for my Thanksgiving pie baking and Christmas cookie baking.  I must say I was disappointed, and feel that the vanilla I purchase at Sam's Club is just as good or perhaps better.  This didn't add anything extra to any of my baked goods, but didn't hurt them either.  I would say it's just another vanilla, but way overpriced.  I won't be buying it again.	12	7

1	B000FBM4AI	A1EGD990Z9WJAY	The perfect food	Back in the 60s and 70s I used to eat the sweetened version of Familia muesli -- now I don't tolerate sugar too well, and also my sweet tooth doesn't take as much to satisfy it as previously.<br /><br />This unsweetened version is perfect for me.  It has lots of oats, as well as other grains and chopped nuts and dried fruit.<br /><br />I add some more stuff (walnut pieces, almonds, hazel nuts if I can get them, and raw cashews, along with extra raisins) and keep it in a plastic container.  Usually for breakfast at work I will line a plastic container with plain yogurt, then put in a helping of Familia, then fresh fruit, maybe bananas, apples, or peaches, and maybe a little nutmeg or cinammon for variety.<br /><br />This is living!  And it's excellent for your health!  I'm tickled that Amazon carries this, because it's harder to get in stores than previously.	1	0

-1	B000PDWBKO	A3WNIMEEYRA2X	Not very impressed at all...	I ordered the Little Bambino popcorn popper along with a 24ct. box of this popcorn.  All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a breeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.<br /><br />Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.  I tried to alter the steps in different ways hoping the popcorn would come out better but it just didn't work out for us.<br /><br />Gonna give good 'ol Mr. Redenbacher a shot next.  Now I just need to figure out how to cancel my 'popcorn subscription'.	5	3

Always bought the king size; the chocolate was thicker and the whole thing just had more flavor, because it was loaded with peanuts and caramel. Really felt like you got your money's worth, which is becoming increasingly rare. Unfortunately, it appears Snickers has jumped on the bandwagon of charging more for less, and now is trying to pass off an inferior item as a ""king size"" candy bar, hoping the customers will play along. Another terrific product bites the dust."	7	0

1	B001650VTI	A28ZWPCE746N62	for those who don't like coffee	This chai latte used to come in those little tin cans like their international coffees do, but then they stopped doing that and it became unavailable.  Most sad.  Having found it for sale on Amazon.com was a blessing.  Now I don't have to make a special trip to Starbucks to get it for $5/cup.  Yeah!  It is tea but it leans towards a cocoa flavor and is delicious. Each bag lasts a long time so I don't run out after just a couple of cups.  Nice job.	2	0
1	B001ABUYIQ	AZG438ZR5Y51J	MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate	The MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a very interesting drink. Not knowing what to expect [I speculated that the hot chocolate would have a touch of heat], I made a cup as soon as it was delivered. To my surprise, it has a strong cinnamon [and probably nutmeg] flavor - it is a good hot chocolate.<br /><br />I mix the chocolate powder with steamed/frothed milk from my espresso maker - I find this makes the drink much better. It takes a couple of cups to really make an opinion, but I think it is a good hot chocolate to drink every day.	0	0

It is not real Chai tea, but a Hawaiian version of it.<br /><br />If you need something to pad an order for Free Shipping, consider the Lahaina Spice. The other 2 varities taste like Lipton black tea.	0	0
-1	B003GTR8IO	AM8W6Y3HVXLZT	Met expectations, sadly.	"Nice packaging.  Makes one imagine rich vanilla flavor -- upon opening, this just smells rather thin, a sense reinforced when actually brewed.  VERY thin vanilla flavor.  I'd say delicate, but a more appropriate term would be weak.<br /><br />But the coffee isn't weak:  if you're into Starbucks' fare, this won't disappoint.  Since I'm not into Starbucks' fare (I subscribe to the narrative that they've hoodwinked the country into blithely accepting the fallacy that strong, acidic/bitter coffee is Primo, which it isn't), I wasn't surprised by the rather nasty aftertaste that not even 3-4 sugars per cup can mask.<br /><br />I love strong coffee, but good coffee can be strong and not offensively acidic with a bite at the end of the quaff that can peel taste-buds off.  It's all in the beans and the roast.  I don't know why Starbucks foists off fare like this on the public; oh, yes I do -- because it sells to those who don't know better.<br /><br />And, I see we're down to 11 (yes, ELEVEN) oz. ""pounds"" of coffee.  Why send 2 packages of 11 oz. (2 x 11 = 22), when one could just put it all into a true ""pound and a half"" 24 oz. bag?  It just makes no sense, the packaging costs are higher, and it's hardly more environmentally friendly this way.<br /><br />When I tell people I used to live in Seattle, they frequently say, ""OH, you must have gone to Starbucks all of the time.""  ""Only when I had no other choice,"" is my response.  If one is willing to pay boutique prices for coffee, one can do FAR better.  In fact, even if one is NOT willing to pay boutique prices for coffee...."	0	0

Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever.	1	0
1	B001L1IU5E	A340JZCSDLLAKK	Try this tea if you don't like the taste of green tea	I had never liked the flavor of green tea but I was trying to drink it because of the health benefits but no matter how much I tried to drink regular green tea, I couldn't get it down because of the taste.  So I decided to order this flavor along with their other green tea flavor, Citrus Green, and now I can finally drink and enjoy green tea.  I steep the tea for 5 minutes for best flavor.<br /><br />The cherry flavor is very light, just enough to let you know it is flavored but not so much that it is overwhelming.<br /><br />I have been drinking both flavors of Gevalia green tea for over 10 years now and I like them so much that I usually ask for them as Christmas gifts from family and friends.	7	0
-1	B001DY6TWU	A105BOR5D5S7CJ	After feeding for 5 years, we're done	We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.	0	0

-1	B001BM62T4	A1XDMYX8QOW07N	Not A Good Espresso Substitute but OK for Rooibos Chai	"I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup."	3	1

It just doesn't seem right. However, this sauce does have a relatively good ""mexican"" flavor and it is good for other things, like a salad or a sandwich. The ""creamy"" part of it is definitely there. Seems like milk, or some component of it, is a prominent feature. Not for me, but some may find uses for it."	1	1

-1	B001714V1U	A1MESYC7PFLX5F	Weak and over-priced considering the taste.	I tried this tea, based on the 5 star reviews of the other reviewers. Perhaps none of the other reviewers have been to Japan or tried real Sencha.<br />I was severely let down. This tea is weak at best, and not a good representative of Japanese Sencha bagged tea.<br /><br />Instead I would recommend Maeda-en, Yamamotoyama, and MyGreenTea as better tasting and more authentic Sencha. Amazon sells all of those 3. Considering the price of Harney & Sons tea, spend your money on a better tea. Even Kirkland brand green tea has more flavor vs. Harney & Sons.	0	0

Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.	6	0

But it is not well mixed because you either get a bit of fishy salmon or the taste of chili lime sauce.  Whatever they were trying, it did not work.<br /><br />With the salmon spread, you get a package of six LAte July Organic Classic Rich Crackers.  The crackers are fine but any health benefit from the organic is lost in the fat calories.<br /><br />Next you have a package of Sweet Perry Orchards Ginger Zip & Nut Mix.  This is a very standard dried fruit and nut mix.<br /><br />You get a package of Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame.  I know a lot of people who love edamame but I am not one of them and having dry roasted edamame is even worse.  It tastes like dry soy beans without the flavour.<br /><br />For desert you get Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark Chocolate Square.  This is the one thing that not only tasted good but had a great texture.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a good meal replacement as the total calories of 410 and 16 grams of fat will not fill you up.

1	B00028HN64	A1M47LJI5QV0HY	Healthy, easy to make, and apparently very tasty!	All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!	3	0
1	B004YV80O4	A3KZ7OH4VRL048	Easy, inexpensive and good	That title about sums it up. Total prep time is about 20 minutes, and in addition to the package's contents all you need is a pound of ground beef and two cups of water. In the last step you may look at the amount of cheese sauce they want you to add and hesitate, but that block of Velveeta is only that intimidating when it is in one solid chunk; once you mix it in it looks like the front of the package. Each box gets you roughly four normal-sized servings.<br /><br />This may just be me hearkening back to my old college dorm days, but I tried it cold (having refrigerated about 2/3 of it, as I was cooking for one that night) and actually enjoyed it just as much as I did right after taking it off the skillet.<br /><br />In short, this is one easy box dinner I will be returning to several times.	1	0

I like a rich, full-bodied (but not bitter) cup of coffee, which this most assuredly is not.  Maybe if you like lots of cream and sugar, and just a touch of coffee flavor..."	2	2
-1	B000LKV4QI	AIRW1I4F5WEJR	Very healthy but super tasteless	I bought this based on the great reviews. I appreciate that it's super healthy, but it tastes very bland and the texture is rock hard (think grape nuts w/ hard raisins). I feel like I'm going to lose my fillings w/ every bite. I tried soaking it in milk for a few minutes but to no avail. The box suggests serving it either cold or hot after cooking it over the stove. I can see why it should be cooked soft.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this cereal but I don't. My husband hates it too. We're wondering how we're ever going to finish all 6 boxes (I'm mixing it w/ other cereals for now).	2	4

1	B004AFGES8	A1XR313UWHKZ6L	Really a wholesome breakfast	We initially tried few sample from Ralph's and our Baby started liking it .. We don't give formula to our Baby and we give only Mom's milk.<br />i think when we combine that with this wholesome breakfast you will have a satisfaction that you are really taking a good care of the Baby..<br />What's more it had got more calories than the regular baby foods and it had got 35% iron which i consider important.. It has dates in it. Very few baby foods for breakfast have dates in them.. on the whole it's really a wholesome breakfast.. Add organic on top of that what else can you ask for.. I had only one thing to complain about.. it's availability is rare.. i had to wait for a month to get it.. I don't find it in the store shelves either..	0	0

-1	B005VOOM2W	A3PNBZ60XRKZFP	not a fan	I did not enjoy this coffee. This is more of that old world kind of beverage. You are drinking and feel transported 200 years ago, when they did not have keurig's and startbucks, if you know what I mean. It almost feels dusty. Not enough boldness, not enough flavor, not enough depth. Not for me.	1	1
1	B000LQORDE	A33YZNZIRA3H97	thick chewey noodles	"The big problem with most instant noodles is that the thin noodles get soggy and mushy when sitting in a bowl of soup, then loose quickly their flavor. These thicker noodles avoid that problem and are tasty until you finish the whole bowl. Yes, the soup is spicey, but you don't have to use the whole spice packet if you are a wimp. Just be careful if you are on a diet, since one package if 500 calories (the ""per serving"" label is for less than half a package).<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because instant noodles have so much fat and salt. Regular dried noodles are much healthier, if don't mind waiting a few more minutes for them to cook."	2	1
1	B007TJGZ5E	A2708XMGVXIHJ4	Good Coffee, Bad Price	I really enjoy this coffee, not too strong, not too weak.  And it doesn't leave an after taste.  All that said, I decided to buy locally becausee I can get a better price, even the regular price. So I gave it a 4 for the price.  Also, anyone want to tell me why the 48 count is more expensive than ordering 2 of the 24 count?  LOL	0	0
-1	B000MXGMFM	A3PW6V55QSD0FH	Product is good, packaging needs improvement	The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.	1	0

-1	B00437AB1O	A10MBPTTQA249A	Design Smudgy & Dirty Inside the General Mills Box	I bought these for a cute celebration of St. Patrick's Day for my Team Members.  I was trying to decide between the little boxes and these and chose the cup over the box because of the convenience of just adding milk to the cup.  Though the idea was still cute, each cup had very smudged artwork and the cups all had black ash on the outside of them while sealed in the General Mills box.  It was so bad, I almost thought they might be counterfeit.  The cereal seemed to taste the way it should, but since I bought these for their branding and aesthetics too, I was disappointed. Next time I'll get the small boxes instead.	2	3
1	B000E0C7Z2	A2IBEM8O86BBLL	Delicious with some Tweaking!	"This hot chocolate is delicious with some tweaking. I originally bought it because I cannot find hot chocolate in the store that does not contain any hydrogenated oils or a ton of sugar. Nestle is the only one who doesn't in their fat-free mix, but then you have the nasty artificial sweetners to deal with. I was ecstatic when I came across this (hopefully a dream come true) on Amazon and ordered it.<br /><br />I have to admit, my first batch wasn't very good. I followed the directions, and found the hot chocolate to be very strong. I like more of a milky chocolatey taste as opposed to a dark chocolatey taste in my hot chocolate.<br /><br />I consume sugar very sparingly, so I used both liquid and powdered Stevia with this chocolate. It produced okay results, but nothing really spectacular. I love Dagoba chocolate bars, so was expecting to be ""wowed"" by the hot chocolate, too. I was a little disappointed when I wasn't.<br /><br />I was camping on my third try making this chocolate, and gave up on the Stevia. I made the batch with half of the chocolate called for, and the only other item I had on hand that was sweet (I don't carry sugar)  was a bottle of organic pure maple syrup. I added a teaspon ot two of this to my cup, and voila! It was a totally different experience.<br /><br />After only adding half of the chocolate called for, and using both Stevia and a little bit of pure maple syrup, was this chocolate exceptional.<br /><br />I was finally able to taste the true colors and depth of this delicious chocolate. It kind of reminded me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate because it has so much going on with it as far as the colors and depth go. Mexican chocolate is very flavorful, and this chocolate is too, with tweaking.<br /><br />Also, be sure to whisk the chocolate *very* well when heating up the milk (or other milk-type beverage) or you will end up with big clumps of unsweetened, unmelted chocolate in your cup. As it stands, when I whisk and whisk and whisk, I still get small clumps of chocolate in my cup.<br /><br />I rated this 4 stars because after tweaking, the choclate was delicious. If I hadn't had to tweak it, it would definitely get 5 stars. I would imagine if you just used sugar, you might not have the problems I had in the beginning."	5	0
-1	B00124WCHC	A31L967UMFOLPT	Its OK.	"I like that this is made with natural ingredients.  The flavor and texture are not as good as artificial brands.  Still its not bad.  I usually pop 2 or 3 to get the flavor to last.  Of course that makes them more expensive.  Xylitol is a ""cool"" sweetener which gives it a slightly minty taste.  Be careful with Xylitol around pets.  Its very harmful to dogs."	0	0

So for smoothies, I definitely recommend this flavor, as well as the vanilla, black cherry, and raspberry."	0	0
-1	B004YV80OE	A2AY83K9N60V38	it's ok but nothing great	We love boxed meals because they're so easy to make after a long day and better for you than fast food.  However, we do get tired of the same ole', same ole' meals so decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />First off, they recommend 1 inch pieces of chicken which really cutting them even smaller would have been much better.  Personally I didn't care for the flavor but I love velvetta cheese so I'm guessing that's due to the seperate spice packet that you have to add to the mixture.  What I do love is that there's a completely seperate package with the brocolli so you can add a little of it or a lot depending on your personal tastes.<br /><br />My husband said the dinner was actually very good though he agrees the flavor is a bit dull.	1	0

If they even think I'm going to pick up that bag they are all screaming and running in circles. My oldest has asthma and is on an inhaler, which involves putting a mask over her nose and mouth. She loves these treats so much that she will actually ask me to give her the inhaler so that she can get rewarded with these treats afterwards. I have never had them go so nutty over a treat.

-1	B001GVISYM	A2QOBRR7RLIQFS	Nasty	This coffee is pretty much nasty. A very light roast that has little taste other than acid. The only way we've been able to drink it is by making a blend with a much darker roast. Definitely one of the worst whole bean coffees I've ever purchased.	2	8

-1	B000I1RHMU	A1HGIBUOYSL3I5	no lemon. not much green tea	"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."	0	1
-1	B000EQYQBO	A19LPZA84LGD98	Oily taste	These chips were disappointingly oily tasting and somewhat stale, even out of a freshly opened bag. I even opened a second bag to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. The chips are crisp enough, but taste like they were fried in old oil.	2	0

It looks like a cannoli with the rawhide wrap on the outside and bone / peanut butter flavor on the inside.

-1	B005YYFHCS	A1HKHIP6VCMALP	Apparently Stevia does not belong in sodas	Greatly appreciate Amazon carrying this product, as it affords customers the opportunity to evaluate this product.<br /><br />The case arrived without the Dr. Zevia (Dr. Pepper cans).  Ginger root beer had been substituted and doubled.  Unfortunately, I bought this specifically to try the cola, ginger ale, and Dr. pepper equivalents.<br /><br />The grape and orange are the better products, although they have no coloring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, almost all of the soda's have an aftertaste...reminiscent of saccharin in some peoples opinion.<br /><br />Some found the taste to be cloying.  No one found any taste to be fresh, crisp, or refreshing.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for Stevia in soda.<br /><br />Even Canada dry diet ginger ale has more ginger taste than Zevia ginger ale.  Zevia cola did not remind me of any similar cola I have ever had.  In fact, a blind test would have revealed a mildly sweet beverage with no outstanding taste markers and of benign flavor.	3	2
-1	B0000VJ55U	A3JM50PVHGZFR6	the good, the bad	we order this for our diabetic cat. she has done well for three years with insulin shots twice a day. But we wanted to save the trip to the vets for bloodwork updates and insulin adjustments. We thought we would stress her out less and save a few dollars. Looking at paperwork that came with package we decided to call company and get a report of what is in the little pieces of paper that you place in the litter box. They sent out the requested paperwork. Upon reading it we decided it may not be worth the risk to the cat...if the cat while cleaning herself injected the tiny papers that have chemicals on it. Our vets is close to our house and we will have your monitored that way. On the other hand, we think it's a great product IF you can monitor your cat when it exits the cat box and make sure there are no test papers on it's fur, that may work. When we used the test we did not get a color change, not sure if the cat was in normal range or the test was flawed. We'd have to use a few times to really know for sure.	3	1

-1	B002QWP8H0	A2YCEKVUN1W5F1	I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half	I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up.	0	2
1	B0061IUKDM	ACAXV4V8PBCE3	An delicious and sustainable tea!	I am an avid tea drinker, usually hot, and all year long. Even in the hottest weather, I still like my hot tea, so I was very pleased to be able to have a chance to try out this Higgins and Burke green tea.<br /><br />I love this product. Not all green teas are the same. Some have a sharp bite at the end and leave the tongue feeling dry and tangy. Others are too dark and strong for me, and I have to remove the bag as soon as the hot water has poured over it to keep it from getting even stronger.<br /><br />But this Higgins & Burke Green Tea is excellent. Even after sitting for five minutes (recommended time is 1-3), it has a warm, mellow brown color to it. It has a light scent, and a very light and pleasing taste - no after bite. This tea has added lemon grass and lemon balm herb, but I can't taste the lemon at all. What I get from this combination is a light sweetness so that no added sugar, honey, or sweetener is needed.<br /><br />The other wonderful thing about this product is that each bag is individually wrapped in a moisture seal pouch. I know this means there is extra packaging to discard or recycle, but really it is excellent because once the box is opened, all the tea bags will stay fresh. Also, this extra packaging means that I can carry these in my purse or backpack.<br /><br />Finally, and one of the most important items for me is that Higgins & Burke is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership which promotes social and environmental sustainability and fair trade. What a major plus!!!	0	0

1	B0029O0EFG	A132I7J24U5DKW	My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.	My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.	2	0

She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me.	1	0
-1	B0081XIAOQ	AHNOARBPIQ24X	Not for smart dogs or large treats/kibble	It's a good feeding mechanism for my dog who scarfs food, but as far as a toy that challenges her, it's a cakewalk.  It's a great start for Kyjen to start marketing to people that love Nina Ottoson but don't want/can't spend $40 on one toy.  I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.	0	0
1	B0049T0DXC	A1Z6JOLTHED5KV	Picky Senior Cat LOVES THEM	"Again... these are CAT TREATS, not an AUDIO CD as the review title states.<br /><br />I got these as a trial size treat in an order from another vendor and my female LOVES THEM. They are easy for her to eat because the pieces are very small and softer than a normal kibble. She begs for them, very unusual.<br /><br />Thanks to the other reviewer, Rachel, for reminding us to be very careful when introducing changes into our pets' diets. They are all unique and react differently. I forgot that treats are not ""food"" when I let my kitty eat a whole trial size pack of these in one day because she loved them so much. No adverse effects, but since I'm so busy cleaning up barf piles from my other cat's delicate tummy (not from these, just a regular thing), I needed the heads up.<br /><br />Also, thanks to Pat for letting me know I can buy them locally right down the street.  There's nothing like paying more for the shipping than for the product.  No problem when I'm buying other things from the vendor too but if all I want is a 3 ounce bag of cat treats... I'll pass."	0	0

1	B000MDHHOC	A36XNK7ELZBHQE	Simply the best there are	I've tried too many sardines to count and these are the very best you can buy. Don't waste time, energy and money on others unless you want to really appreciate how good these tender tasty Tiny Tots really are, as they marinade in that wonderfully thick extra virgin olive oil. I hope these things are in heaven if I manage to make it there. My second choice to these would be a beef tenderloin smoke grilled slowly over wood chipped charcoal.	0	0
1	B0007N218O	A4FENPVEXNFWA	Hooked on Lakerol!	I never liked gum!  I'd chew it for about 5 minutes until the flavor was all gone and that would be it.  So I'm  not a gum chewer, and not much on hard candies, either.  Then I discovered Lakerol!  A cross between gum and candy, and the flavor is great and lasts.  The perfect confection!  Wish they weren't quite so pricey, but a case lasts me almost a year.  And while there are different flavors, and I've tried most of them, I'm stuck on the original - and never tire of it.  Just the perfect, refreshing chew at work, while driving, etc. - and freshens the breath a bit, too.  Thanks Lakerol!	0	0
-1	B000FVBYCW	A5CR6GP49HVEE	Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me	I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.	2	0

Read the label carefully, it's instant coffee, not the ground coffee as the other brands, no filter inside, and had partially hydrogenated oil in it, I returned it as hydrogenated oil is harmful and the coffee itself is kind of gas station quality.	2	1
-1	B001VNP1T0	AB3T5SRHH7MNG	This is cassia-not cinnamon	Yes this is a great deal for cinnamon.. but in actuality it is technically not cinnamon.  Everything that I have read has said that cassia has similar properties and taste to cinnamon but it is NOT, in fact, cinnamon.  This is not a problem if you are using it in arts & crafts or some kind of potpourri, but when it comes to ingesting these (or even attempting to grind them with your coffee grinder- I think they will make short order of your grinder (They are very hard). They also contain a substance called coumarin in a dose high enough to cause liver damage to sensitive individuals. I'm bummed, because I was going to use them to eat/drink, but now I guess my apartment will just smell like cinnamon..everywhere..	29	7

-1	B0000CEQ9T	AYZDM477KKQ6S	An utter disappointment and waste of money	I live in Central Asia, in a place where brown rice is unknown.  I come back to the US and buy supplies for a year, paying for product and airfreight.  This rice has almost no taste.  There seems to be neither energy nor nutritional value.  Eating it gives me nothing but irritation to have spent so much money and confined myself to a year of dead rice or no rice.  Actually, it has accustomed me to not eating rice.<br /><br />The package was intact.  The sell-by date was okay.  I had never bought this brand before and I never shall again.	5	4

-1	B000NURB18	A1ST2ICFVJOLJ3	Very warm and spicy	This is a very strong, spicy cinnamon tea, great for cold days.  However, you do need to really like cinnamon to enjoy this tea.  I find I have to be in the right mood for it, as it can be overpowering.  In contrast, I have a friend who LOVES it, and just bought her 2nd box of 50 bags of this tea. It's well-blended, but it's serious about its cinnamon.	0	0

-1	B000EZMRQG	A46GF93IPE7EY	What Happened???	This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.	0	0

Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'	0	0

We tried many brands of canned food including Blue Wilderness, Tiki Cat and Instinct; all of which left unfavorable results. We then moved on to Weruva and my Blue Boy can't get enough!

1	B003QNJYXM	A3TK3FMI9IWZQ8	Energy, Anxiety, Caffeine...  No Problems	I am VERY sensitive to Caffeine. It can send me into a full blown anxiety attack.  This product, for some reason had NO adverse effects for me.  If this is usually an issue for you, I would suggest trying 1/2 a bottle and seeing how you tolerate it.  I had energy.  Since it has B12 vitamins in it, my mood was also enhanced. I felt excited and energetic.  The berry flavor tastes like Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  Almost exactly like that.  There was no crash AND I was able to sleep well that night.  Sound too good to be true!? It was for me. I am SERIOUSLY trying to resist the urge to stock up and buy a whole case.  This stuff is great.  I was in a show with someone who had trouble focusing, was moody and forgetful.  We were on stage and he was often a mess... One night he did an amazing job, and I asked him what was different... He said... I took a 5 Hour Energy drink.  I was stunned and still not convinced... but saw the drink in a store and had to try it.  WOW!  That is all I can say! WOW! It's great!!!	5	1
1	B000HAAAKI	A18XFUP3J4T8KF	So Much Better than Coffee	I fell in love with coca tea while doing research in highland Peru, and I love that it's available in the US.  The other reviewer is right, it really does have a distinctive, delicate taste and I also prefer it piping hot with a little sugar, although my husband wants to try it iced.  This is a must-have for tea drinkers, and it's quite lovely in that it gives a nice pick-me-up with no aftereffects like caffeine.	10	1
1	B000S11CD0	A260DR5GXQ5NMJ	It's Cornflour	It's cornflour, period.  But, ground as only Masa is to make a good corn tortilla. It has great flavor.  Tortillas can be a real pain in the fanny to make.  Too many people worry about how it doesnt look like a commercial tortilla...but, I'll bet you that crooked as it is..it will leave Tia Rosa in the dust.  The hardest part is getting the mix right.  After that all you need is a rolling pin and two pieces of wax paper.  Make a few and you will get the hang.<br /><br />You really don't need a tortilla press.  What you really need is practice.	9	6

-1	B0029O10P4	A3PNDHFUA8EG4O	My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.	Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.	0	0
-1	B000P6MSOU	A2BOGWVZ40AKPO	Variety Pack	Not bad but not great either. My children of course love the cookies but when it comes to the crackers they just tell me they are extremely dry and pasty.

-1	B0038LE5RM	AH1YIQVT59533	Not what I thought it was	First thing is that I was disappointed in myselft for not realizing that this was only 12 k-cups instead of 24 but I guess that was my error for not reading in more careful.  The other thing is that when it came, a couple of the cups did not have loose powder in them.  The powder in the cup was stuck together and hard.  The last time I used a k-cup that had hard stuck together powder...my machine overflowed from the top because the water couldn't make it through the k-cup.<br /><br />I love the chai latte k-cups but I paid to much for 12 k-cups and I can't use a couple of them because they have the hard powder.	0	0

-1	B0041NYV8E	AVZ1SYMD26S4R	intense ginger flavor	A single pouch of this tea makes a small very strong cup of ginger flavored tea. The small grains dissolved instantly. I could not taste any lemon flavor and very little if any honey flavor. The Ginger was almost medicinally strong and somewhat bitter, though it did not sting the throat like fresh ginger does at this intensity, nor did it clear the sinus. I think this is too strongly flavored to accompany most food, though it might go well with some cookies or possibly cheese. I do not know if it would be effective for motion sickness or other nausea and so far as I can tell this is being marketed as a beverage. It is not particularly sweet but also has none of the tartness one expects from lemon. The strength reminded me of  a very strong ginger ale without the fizz.  I can see that this might be convenient to take on the road  but for day to day use I think I will stick with making my own ginger, lemon and Honey drinks with fresh ingredients.	0	0

After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my ""stomach of steel"" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be."	2	2

I also tried to pull the rope when the bottle is upside down and still no treats. I tried several sizes of treats/food to see if perhaps that would help and still no treats.

You can keep the can stored in your cupboard for months if it isn't opened, but you need to consume it relatively quickly once it is opened (just something to keep in mind for people who are single or who have small families).	1	0

-1	B001PO7FDU	A3JRKGMYF3F09Z	extremely deceptive business practice--product made with chemicals not truffles	"I am disgusted that they are allowed to get away with tricking people. There is no actual truffle used in this product but they do everything they can to convince you that there is. The ingredients say organic sunflower oil and white truffle extract. Extract makes you think it was extracted from real truffles, doesn't it? Well, it wasn't. The extract is a chemical compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles.<br /><br />How about where it says in the label that ""White truffles originate in Alba, Italy and are considered to many to be the most prestigious truffles""...do you suppose that means white truffles from Italy have anything to do with this concoction? Well, they don't. They might as well have written, ""The sun is so and so many miles away from the earth."" They put that sentence in just to further trick you so you think that you are getting an expensive product with a grand tradition behind it when all you are getting is some cheap oil with some synthetic chemical added to it.<br /><br />They should be ashamed of themselves. Should they be allowed to sell you a synthetic chemical to eat? Maybe. Should they be allowed to market the product to convince customers that they are getting a product made with real truffles? No, they absolutely should not. We have food laws that are supposed to protect customers from this sort of trickery. The FDA has really dropped the ball on this.<br /><br />Update: They are getting even trickier. Their label has now been changed to read truffle extract instead of truffle aroma. I called the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see section 201 for definitions) has never defined the term extract. I was specifically told this on the phone by an FDA representative. She said because the term extract has not been legally defined by this act, anything can be called an extract. Thus, La Tourangelle can legally get away with calling something a truffle extract even if truffles weren't used to make it."	22	5

I am quite disappointed to find that:<br /><br />1) nuts are only peanuts<br />2) I need magnifying glass to see the real peanuts<br />3) cereal is very sweet<br />4) a bowl of cereal and milk is not at all filling<br /><br />There is so much sugar (honey) that the flakes glisten. It is as crunchy as Kellog's corn flakes. They don't get soggy as quickly though - probably the sugar coating delays the process.<br /><br />Serving size is 3/4 cup and has 120 calories, 2% fat, 7% sodium, and 11g sugars. Ingredients (in order) are corn, sugar, peanuts, honey, and so on. As you can see there is more sugar than peanuts!<br /><br />In contrast, regular Kellog corn flakes serving size is 1 cup and has 100 calories, 0 fat, 8% sodium and 2g sugars.<br /><br />We will definitely not buy these cereals.	1	0

Hard, expensive, you name it, I thought it. However, I've been needing a food item to include in my daily diet to fill the sweet crunchy void so I gave Kashi another try. Lo! A free full size Kashi bar in the mail- the one with chocolate chips and it was excellent! And not made of excess garbage chemicals and unecessary sugars and fats that clog up your heart and brain. I went to the Kashi website and printed their coupons, bought some Heart to Heart cereal and- didn't like it. I thought ""dog food, boring, etc., etc. But I ate it.I began to appreciate the quality of the product, the subtle not-too-sweet crispness of the cereal and now I eat it dry more often not. If you don't like one Kashi product, try others, you're bound to find something you'll enjoy. Kashi products are excellent products that are clean, healthful, and more apt to do your body good than many of the other sugary over processed products on the market now days."	1	0

-1	B0018CG2RY	A2SCJ5MH67HNZ0	Never again	We decided to try this dogfood because it was a few dollars cheaper than the Iams weight control that we normally buy.  We have spent FAR more than those few dollars in paper towels and cleaning supplies.  I guess because of the name, we thought it was a premium dog food.  If it is, it is the worst stuff we have ever tried.  I would go back to a cheap brand before ever buying this stuff again.  The dogs may lose weight, but if so, the dehydration from the diarrhea is a much worse consequence.  I expected some digestive problems with the change, but it has been almost 2 weeks, and no change in the problem.  I had to go to the store and buy our usual.  I wont even set this stuff out where stray dogs can get it.  Lesson Learned!	1	4

Somehow, they managed to make it taste even worse, with the added benefit of getting caught in your throat and causing a sawdusty coughing fit.

-1	B0090X8IPM	A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3	Yes, I do like flavored coffees BUT.....	I just want to preface this review by noting that I do stop into Starbucks and get flavored coffees (current favorite, Peppermint Mocha, whipped cream on top). So I had positive expectations of a vanilla flavored coffee. Unfortunately, this was among the worst Starbucks blends I've ever tasted. Just to give it a fair shot, I tried brewing and drinking it four different ways:<br /><br />1.Mild with no sugar or cream<br />2. Strong with no sugar or cream<br />3. Mild with sugar and cream<br />4. Strong with sugar and cream<br /><br />I also had friends taste test this. We all hated it. We couldn't choke it down as it was truly bitter and unpleasant. Maybe we got a bad batch or bag. At this point, we have nearly a whole bag left and I'm feeling guilty about wasting it. But there is no way I'm going to brew another pot of coffee and try to create a tasty brew. I tend to like my coffee extremely strong but even making it overly strong did not make it better. Yes, the vanilla flavor came through but it wasn't a good addition to a possibly decent coffee (without the vanilla).	1	1
-1	B001P05K7W	A20QP8LVD1H5TT	Hextra chews = STAINS	this was my first time buying the hextra chews for my two dogs. they like them but i had no idea that it would leave stains on my rugs, carpet and furniture since the product description had no warning of this. i read some reviews where others didn't have this staining problem so maybe i just got a bad batch? even so, i wouldn't recommend the hextra chews just incase and would suggest getting the other version, C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces.	0	0
-1	B000P504ZG	A2WBJCUK776FKY	Not terrible but I won't purchase again	Usually, I go to Whole Foods and try to buy a single bar of a brand or flavor I haven't tried before purchasing an entire box... & I should have followed that rule before making this purchase.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I love the tart twang of cranberry and orange together - but the additional ingredients in this bar made it overly sweet for my taste.  I also found the texture to be quite gritty and overly moist.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars for the quality of the ingredients and because it would likely appeal to those who enjoy REALLY sweet fruit treats.<br /><br />I think in the future I will go back to Lara Bars.	7	0

When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it...

-1	B000EEWZBE	A2A1XYSB692L6J	Y U M M Y......I N E X P E N S I V E......B U T.....S O M E W H A T.....D R Y	"I recently re-read of how good sardines are for people, in ""EAT THIS, NOT THAT, BEST AND WORST FOODS IN AMERICA"" Edition.  Believe it or not, SARDINES were listed amongst ""the best foods you've never heard of"" (!)  I'll admit most of the other foods listed ARE somewhat new to me....but SARDINES?  I've been eating them since I can remember!  They are NOT a ""strange new food"" to me -- and, I hazard to guess, to most people in the western,(and pronbably also the eastern), world!<br /><br />EAT THIS, NOT THAT, author David Zinzenco mentions that ""Crown Prince"" is the bargain brand of sardines, and -- always on the outlook<br />for a bargain, I decided to get some Crown Prince sardines.  This particular variety, 'CROWN PRINCE BRISTLING SARDINES IN OIL/ NO SALT ADDED"", caught my eye, because I've been eating a LOT of processed foods from the supermarket lately....most of them with a lot of salt.<br />After eating far too much, I could feel my heart going, ""pitter-patter, pitter-patter"", far too fast!  As there were no pictures of<br />my favourite movie or TV stars around, I knew this was a danger-sign I had eaten too much salt!<br /><br />These sardines are packed in SOYBEAN oil -- not the olive oil recommended by Mr. Zinzenco.  They are tasty little morsels, and I, at least, don't notice any flavour gone because there is no added salt. (There IS salt -- sodium -- in these sardines, (125 milligrams per serving -- there is one serving listed, per can), but I guess this is only because the sea IS salty, and these sardines, (which are a WILD-CAUGHT, product of Scotland), do come from the sea.  But no salt is ADDED, and this should make for less salt than is had in other, salt-added sardines.<br /><br />It is amazing, though -- despite the relative HUGE amount of soybean oil in each can -- that the sardines inside taste semi-dry.  I have read that the larger, ""skinless and boneless"" variety of sardines, (which are also offered by several manufacturers, and which I have also tried through the years), are not really sardines at all -- they are mackerel! Tasty morsels as well -- but very, very dry.  These CROWN PRINCE BRISTLING SARDINES are NOT THAT dry -- (and, from their somewhat smaller size, and included skins and bones, definitely seem to be sardines and not mackerel) -- but they ARE a good bit drier than any other fully skinned and fully boned sardines I have ever eaten.  This is my one caveat with these sardines.  However, they do have a lesser price, and they do have a lesser salt content.  So, if these things are important to you, a little dryness shouldn't really be a problem.  If it is, I suggest that you get another, fully salted variety of sardines, (perhaps from another manufacturer), open two cans, (one of each), at a time, mix them up, divide the mixture into halves, and put half of the mixture away, (in one of the cans), for another serving!<br /><br />So, nothwithstanding a slight dryness, these less-expensive, less-salt<br />variety of sardines, may be just what you desire!  Yummy!"	5	1
-1	B003M60630	A2FCL1CKPWR3FP	Not what I expected	"I love sweet tea but don't want the extra calories so I opt for unsweetened with Splenda. I was looking for a K-cup tea for iced tea and thought I'd give this one a shot since it claims Perfect Iced Tea. I am sorry I did. It is bitter and has a strong floral taste. I've tried different settings on my brewer and even extra ice and water in it and I still can't make it taste right. I like my iced tea stronger than my family but this one is even too strong for me. It's also ""cloudy"" and looks like ""swamp water"".  I think I'll go back to making iced tea with Celestial English Breakfast Blend. It won't make as big a glass but it's not as over powering."	0	0
1	B001LGGH40	AAKQTXS4JOUR5	Switch Carbonated Juice Drink	"This is an Amazon Vines review of Switch Carbonated Juice Drink.  The flavor I received was Kiwi Berry and the can is 8.3 fluid ounces.<br /><br />I seldom drink sodas, not really caring for sugary drinks.  So when I saw the Switch 100% Carbonated Juice offered I wanted to try it.  The flavor I tried had a good tasting Kiwi flavor, was not sugary, and had a nice carbonation to it that I really enjoyed.  The refreshing drink has just 135 calories and only 15 mgs of salt, so as I drank it, I did not feel like I was drinking an unhealthy sugary beverage.<br /><br />I think this product is a great substitute for soda, provides a nice ""pick me up,"" and is a much healthier product for one to drink than many sodas or other types of drinks that have added sugar, corn syrup, or some type of preservative.<br /><br />I enjoyed this drink and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a healthy and refreshing 100% juice drink."	1	0
-1	B001LG945O	A27UE9HJRZ22YI	I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed	Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.	2	2

Other reviews have gone into great detail on the ingredients and their negative impact on your pet's health so I'm not going to repeat that.  Just chiming in!<br />It frustrates me when people say they can't afford to feed their families or pets good quality, nutritious food (as opposed to factory produced calories packaged in grocery stores and served in restaurants).<br />When you factor in the cost to your health and the fact that you are nutritionally starving yourself (or your family/pets) the cost for good food (and I mean FOOD, not calories) is actually less expensive.<br />Off the soapbox..."	1	0
-1	B001G8W7SI	A3EXF7VYEGYJQZ	caffeine vomit	I love the caffeine. But honestly the flavor is a bit like vomit. Can't explain it. Sour, like a sour stomach were you belch degestive juices up into your mouth.	3	0
1	B001HTKOWC	A2J8BAM4AX4FGA	The Best Green Tea	In my opinion, Stash makes the best Green Tea on the market.  I have tried others and they taste to grassy.  This has a great flavor and makes it easy to enjoy it the health benefits of drinking the tea. Enjoy!	0	0
1	B000LKXBL4	A30H2335OM7RD6	Love Kettle Chips	These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy.	1	1
-1	B000F70SO6	A27XBZ5WEMFDY3	Dry and tasteless...	This bar is from a company in the UK, which is interesting because this is pretty much how I remember all their food tasting when I last visited.  A chunky, crunchy texture with an odd amount of soft pockets as you bite through is completely ruined by the strange sweetness that arises from whichever ingredient is holding the bar together.  Too dry, too many strange textures that just seem the result of sitting on a shelf too long, probably won't please most people unless you've completely given up on fat, sweet or savory flavors in your diet.	0	1
-1	B000CQG8K8	A39EW9DLVX70B9	Stash tea can vary batch to batch	I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.	0	0
1	B00535HCI0	ARGR2TEO4RFOE	oh ... so good!	This was my second order of Goetze's Caramel Creams, and they both arrived fresh.  I know it's always a gamble when you order over the internet, but Amazon has not let me down yet.  If you're a Goetze's junkie give it a try.	1	0
1	B0030VJ97Q	ACU1MBQ7T5YL0	Yummy protein	I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.<br /><br />I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.<br /><br />Also, the chicken, sweet potato is a big hit with my baby.  He ate it all up!<br /><br />These organic meals are a very nice alternative to making my own food for him.	3	0
-1	B001ELLATO	AD8CHFZTR2DJ1	Tellicherry Pepper	"Tellicherry pepper is a good spice but did not live up to the hipe of the extra, full ""peppery"" taste.  It does not jest the flavors of cooked food any more than regular fresh ground pepper. It also is not special as a spice on uncooked foods."	1	0

-1	B000FFLHU2	AZZRFMUO60L7J	Get the capsule!!	My review is not to say the powder can't do wonderful things but the taste is seriously not a joke. I read the other reviews saying the stuff tasted horrible but I figure some people are just like that, I wasn't expecting for it to be great. I tried mixing it with multiple things but there was just nothing that could make it ok. Just ordered the capsule, I am excited for it to come. Anyways, hope this helps.	3	0
-1	B0009X2A60	A1H01TVPL63VDF	Food Allergy	Did a lot of research online to find a reasonably priced quality cat food.  Most supermarket brands and pet shops carry food with lots of grains, which is not good for pets.  Peek at the ingredients and you will probable see corn or corn by-product high on the list.  This food got several high ratings.  I unfortunately bought the large bag without first testing it on my 2 cats. One cat did fine, but the other cat developed watery stools and rash around perineum 3-4 weeks after switching over.  Loose stools and rash continued another week before I switched to a different food and they both cleared up shortly.  Too bad, this is a good quality food at a reasonable price. I'm feeding them California Natural dry food  with good results.	2	1
-1	B005VOOL00	A2LAS014NSRW72	convenient, low-acid, but a bit weak	The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again.	0	0
1	B000FL08B0	A2KWLRLQSOCFT7	Agave vs Sugar	Agave is so much better for you than sugar. Even though the calories are the same, the low glycemic index makes all the difference in the world. Too bad more Americans don't know the importance of the glycemic index. We'd have a less obese society....<br />Organic Raw Blue Agave has a great flavor & consistency!!<br />I highly recommend this product!!!	0	0
-1	B001LQCOIS	A2ZCDFY5M1CZGQ	Food prep unit warped on first use	That's right parents, the unit warped on the first use and basically became a $150 paper weight.<br /><br />We contacted the company and they did happily send replacement parts but geez, you can't have a product going to the crapper after one use. Totally unacceptable.<br /><br />On the bright side, it did do a good job of making the sweet potato goo but it was nothing that boiling a sweet potato and throwing it in a real food processor can't do.	0	3
1	B0014EOU8E	A183S80WADLOCU	Delicious!	Was a heavy soda drinker and decided to quit cold turkey. It was a struggle and constantly on my mind while at work until I picked up a case of this. This, with a reusable tumbler, make for the perfect healthy substitute. I still can't believe it has a full serving of fruits AND vegetables.	2	0
-1	B000Q611U6	A2SH6A32BE6NEV	Tasty, but doesn't leave you full; high calories, expensive.	The Clif bar organic fruit comes in a plastic wrapper that is easy to open so kids (or adults with frail hands) wont have any trouble opening it.  The actual piece of nourishment is only a few inches long as is very sticky so you don't want to get your hands on it<br /><br />There's a slightly spicy, fruity taste to the strawberry flavor I consumed.  I was able to chomp down on the stick in a matter of seconds and I was left not feeling full either.  I could easily eat several of these in one sitting -- but you wouldn't want to do that as these have 70 calories a piece.  If children are consuming these you really need to watch out that they don't have access to too many as they too could easily eat several of these in front of a TV (will make them FAT).<br /><br />Overall, I am not happy about the high calorie count versus feeling of fullness.  Even a granola bar leaves me far more satisfied, but these fruit sticks do no such thing.  The prices is also high, being about 90 cents a piece when bought in the bulk pack.  I would like to see the price decrease to 50 cents a piece at least.  As such, I am awarding only 3 stars to this product.	1	5
-1	B0090X8IPM	A1S27P7KJO9I96	Better coffees out there, not much vanilla flavor	This coffee is slightly better than your average supermarket coffee.  The vanilla flavor is very faint.  If you are looking for vanilla coffee, adding vanilla syrup to your coffee is a better choice.  I prefer fresh roasted coffee from Peets or my local coffee shop.  This is not bad, but lacks that fresh roasted taste.  I rate it average.	1	1
-1	B000E63L6U	A2VJGBFX2VWFOE	Mint and lemon overpower everything else	The mint and lemon flavors are the only ones you feel and together with the others create a weird taste.<br />I typically can eat or drink anything irrespective of how good it tastes, but I just cannot drink this warm !<br />I tried to make iced tea with this which is bearable, because you don't feel the taste.	1	0
-1	B000FYVKW8	A3K3OWF7TEM685	Greasy, not sure what it tastes like.	Having grown up in a hunting family, I grew up eating venison.  I'm not sure what this tastes like but it doesn't taste like the venison I remember eating as a child.  The strips are also rather greasy.	4	1
1	B001EO5KSS	A1JH0XTU3VNDSO	Great Breakfast	I start my day with one of these and a handful of almonds every workday.  I can't imagine a better way to get started.  I have food sensitivities and most granola bars can be problematic.  These bars never trigger a sensitivity.  Also, I do not get a low sugar bounceback an hour later like some of the lighter, more sugary granola bars.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, no other granola bars I have tried over the past 5 years can compare.  One thing of note is that I have noticed differences in batches where some seem better (peanut butter in greater quantity and 'wetter' vs a dry batch).  Both taste great, but the wet batches are finger lickin' good.	0	0
-1	B000FNH1C2	A30H2PF9KDXI56	Gluten free by Nana	I don't know which was worse, the ginger or the lemon cookie.  All I can say is the texture is really off putting to me.  Gluten-free is challenging and getting the best texture is difficult.  Seems like too much reliance on rice flour (cheaper).  Maybe an increase in another gluten-free flour would help.  I ended up donating them to the local food bank.	0	2
1	B0022N6N1S	A1BF0HZ9LE4JTQ	Caramel Flavor powder	I am absolutely thrilled with this caramel flavor powder.  I just got notification that it was shipped yesterday and it arrived this morning.  I have already used it and it is delicious.  Very happy with this product.	0	0
-1	B008JKU2CO	A2E4ROH3UVXCEJ	Good but maybe my package was old.	I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.	1	0
-1	B0042GUIV4	A3KLYCB8MHZ6M4	why buy something when you are getting ripped off?	See's makes delicious chocolates; close to the best; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. I think that every one should boycott See's for that reason.	1	5
-1	B001KPI2EK	A4D9AIUP1NNIY	Quality? Maybe. Taste? Not so good	I have tried some pu erh tea that I enjoyed for the unique taste, however this matcha is either bad quality or I would just not recommend this item. I have had red tea matcha and green tea matcha and this does not even come close in taste or the texture whisked in. I would reccomend not getting this type of matcha at all, that's not to say I don't like this tea, I love it, that's why I ordered the medium size one. If I had to rate this tea from one to ten, this would be in the three to four range.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical forking out so much money for this type of tea since I was well aware of the quality it could be and as well as 'fake' or lower grades being sold for good quality matcha. I downright would prefer the lose leaf tea over this.	0	0
-1	B001E3DPF4	A2OWR2PL3DLWS4	Not that great- especially for the price	I have had much much better caramels- from Trader joes even.  Their salted caramels are actually pretty great.

-1	B008O3G2GG	A1C7Y31S5QXNTR	A clever idea that didn't work.	The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'.	1	1
-1	B005GRAT4O	A1HOUDPBSL69Q	Am shocked at the contents!	"I chose this brand of baby food as I dont have enough time to prepare my own. Organic and nice it seemed. It states from 6 months and up. My son is 7 months. All of a sudden he started drinking large amounts of water which lead me to look closer at the label. There is up to 20 mg of sodium in these things!! A baby under 1 year has no kidney function and cannot eat salt! THen all of a sudden he had break outs in his face. Happened twice. I looked at what he had eaten those two times. SPINACH! A baby under one year should NOT have spinach! I am absolutely puzzled how a company producing food for babies, have no idea about the most general of knowledge concerning babies. I have taken my son off this food and am making my own and can only hope I have not damaged his little body by these two weeks of eating ""Earths Best Organic""!"	1	1

1	B001NZPFB0	A33FP1CULQRANT	Nookie 'n' Hips	"I first found this product about a year ago through their free ""mini-bag"" giveaway. Nookie, my malamute, is a large dog that is susceptible to hip issues. I first had switched her over to the Happy Hips formula and saw that she walked without a limb for the first time in over a year. This took about six months, but was noticeable after about 4 months of eating Happy Hips. I was so pleased with the outcome that I transitioned my smaller, older dog to Happy Hips. My little dog, Steeler, was having back issues as she is getting older. After about 6 months eating Happy Hips, she is out running around like a puppy...she is now 13 years old. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a pet with joint problems or may have those issues later down the road."	2	0

-1	B008O3G25W	A3NAEIB9ZDBJ4I	BUYER BEWARE	This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing.	0	0

-1	B002K660HY	A1K6NNR5X05TXL	Manitoba Dark Chocolate Hemp Powder	This is very grainy and chalky like most other hemp powders I've tried. The taste is fine ( I like chocolate better than other flavors) but I also mix it with vanilla hemp milk, coconut milk, chocolate milk, or whatever else I feel like adding that morning. Tastes don't bother me as much as textures do so if you're like me then the grainy/chalky feel of this is going to be too much on it's own. I have to mix it up with the Nutiva brand hemp powder to smooth it out a little and make it stretch (because Nutiva is more expensive) but is the best that I've had so far.<br /><br />This is pretty much what I was expecting though and you have to remember it is a HEALTH shake and it isn't going to taste fantastic but you can do a lot to alter it more to your liking. If I actually used a real blender and added fruit and honey and some things like that to it the graininess could probably be cut down but I'm lazy and don't have time in the mornings to do that and I'm fine with what I do.	0	0

You'll enjoy it.  You're wife will love you for it.<br /><br />So don't buy pencil erasures, paper clips, or some other such throw away items.<br /><br />Treat yourself to some world-class tea!	3	1
-1	B005GBIXZM	A2CV33795L4KHH	Good idea for certain dogs/needs, but...	As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.	0	0
1	B001LQTDXM	A7DPA1XBILR50	Good Source of Fiber	When I first received my order I was a little disappointed with the barley size, they all kind of small.  But after I cooked it, the size actually doesn't matter.  I ususlly make barley soup or mix with rice.  It's good for making risotto too.  When I cook it with rice, I take 3cups of rice, 1cup of barley and use water for cooking 4cups of rice, set my rice cooker for at least 2~3 hours timer.  The taste is great and I love the texture of barley.  My kids will eat this rice mix without complain.  It gives you a lot more fiber compares with just eating rice. I keep my barley in freezer.	7	0
-1	B002ZX1U9A	A3KZTLFZG7CLP	To light for me	I bought this coffee based on the good reviews that I read. Unfortunately I do not like the taste of the coffee.

Basically if you like coffee which is heavily flavored then this is for you.	0	0
-1	B001G0NKZU	A3H56GU10XZ11J	just okay	I'm glad other people's cat liked these, but my cats are both indifferent to them. I got these because my cat went crazy over the cheese puff treats I bought at Target, I think they are call crispies or something. They literally almost ripped the bag apart when it was left closed sitting on the counter because they can smell it through the bags. I have 2 kittens and they fought each other whenever I grab for the bag, no other time do they act like this it's almost as if it's drugs or something. I was hoping for the same effect with these, but my kittens both treat these like it's slightly tastier dry food. P.S. I have 1 himalayan and 1 orange tabby.	1	0

-1	B002C6GFC2	A4VLYEEVI02MM	Decent plant but not from Bonsai Boy, no free shipping	"I ordered this from Amazon recently and it just arrived.  It was packed well and survived fine, however it's nowhere near as well trained as the one shown in the picture- it's more or less a ball of leaves and branches, less bushy than the photo.  It will need a lot of time to turn into something decent, but then again that's half the fun.  Note that it's 12"" from the base of the pot, not the base of the soil.  (The container is about 10"" by 8"" if you're ordering a drip tray for it)<br /><br />There are two oddities: first, the plant is marked as having free shipping.  It does not- it was $4, which is cheaper than most trees but not free.<br /><br />More oddly, it's not from Bonsai Boy.  It's from a company called Lou's Bonsai.  I'm not sure if they are linked- they use the exact same picture of the tree.  I don't really care who grew it first so long as it's healthy, but Amazon could clear up where it's coming from."	0	0

-1	B0052W6YXS	A1QVJXR72BV9ZL	Not sure that there is actually tea in this product	I should have paid more attention to the photos of this product when purchasing it.. I thought it looked like it was red-ish brown..but it is truly as red as Kool-aid and tastes completely unlike tea to me - it was most like unsweetened Kool-aid in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm an avid iced tea drinker - I drink it year 'round and a pitcher of tea is always at the ready in our fridge. I tried this tea to see if it would be a nice one to add to my rotation (I like Paradise Iced Tea and China Mist Mango & Passion Fruit ice teas). It was so horrible tasting I couldn't drink it. It doesn't taste like Mango at all - it tastes vaguely of herbal hibiscus and rose - it doesn't taste fruity at all.<br /><br />I plan to give it away to someone who likes herbal teas -- because I'm quite certain it lacks any black tea (or any tea at all?)..and therefore wouldn't be useful to me (I like caffeine in my tea).	0	0
-1	B0051COPH6	A1SP366J07MNU	strange taste for babies!	This is a healthy addition to a child's diet. The problem is not with it's nutritional value, but with the taste. Normally most baby foods has a nice sweet taste, that will be appealing even to adults. But this tastes so much like an organic health food. It is assumed that the baby would already be used to better tasting food (at least milk) and introducing this becomes a challenge. Our baby was willing to experiment with this new stuff, but after swallowing a spoonful, he firmly refused to take another. When i tasted it, i could understand his reason. Even the older children, who normally would not have minded pouncing on the baby food, stayed clear of this one.<br /><br />An appealing taste is definitely a factor in any baby food and not just nutritional value, and this lacks a nice taste. I still give it 3 stars because it is organic and if you start your baby early with this, the child may grow used to it.	0	0

That way ants, air, and other things can't<br />contiminate it. I am very content with this prduct.	1	2

1	B001EO5R04	A3KY6HIM0HCIGG	Excellent breakfast tea!	I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.  If you only have a little left in the tin, it blends well with any other black tea.	3	0
-1	B001TM70V0	ACG58F48XLHA4	Cats won't eat this flavor because they don't like picking out the bones	At first my cats enjoyed this flavor, but after a few cans they slowed down and started to eat less of it or reject it completely. The times they did nibble at the food, large fish bones and spinal columns were left at the bottom of their bowls. I think my cats simply don't like the flavor because they don't like having to pick all the bones out.	0	2
-1	B000CMF1A0	A3SCIP098VYA23	Not really balanced	I love the licorice tea so I thought I would love this too.  But the mint is too strong and you don't really get the licorice flavor.  I'll stick to the Egyptian Licorice instead.	0	0
1	B005ZZLKU4	A26N48LWS9EBJ7	Delicious SoBe, Ridiculous Price	"This stuff is pretty good considering it's not true coconut water but a sugary, natural mystery flavor ""coconut water beverage."" I am a fan of natural coconut water, and this is a tasty candy coated variation that makes a nice treat. It's good, but not $4.79 a bottle good. Even organic, fair trade, macrobiotic, super magical coconut water horn-picked by unicorns and poured by the tiny hands of endangered squirrel monkeys, sold at the overpriced trendy boutique health food store is less than $4.79 a bottle. Not sure who came up with the pricing here, but my local Mass Retailer store has it on sale for $0.80 a bottle at the moment, so I'll probably just continue to buy it there instead."	5	0

-1	B006YZK758	A2TJG4N8LNJW23	Mediocre is the only appropriate word...	One of the really big selling points of the Keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee. Teas, cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them. I did my research after we got our brewer for Christmas, though, and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it. It had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so I held out hope that it would work out. I brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot. The consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like the no calorie Swiss Miss hot chocolate available in sleeves. While you're drinking it, it tastes alright, but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste. There's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and I can see how that would bother a lot of people, especially those with sensitive taste buds.<br /><br />I think we'll finish the rest of the box, but I'm not convinced we'll repurchase. We'll probably just use the Keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets.	0	0

1	B004SKOOHI	A166PZWEYC7NNL	The best of all the Combos	"We are big fans of the Combos, so when I saw the Pepperoni Pizza ones here on Amazon, I had to buy them. They are by far the favorite within our household. Combos in general are an excellent option for those who are tired of chips or crackers-they are packed with flavor, and don't give your fingers the ""Cheetos"" residue, plus you can eat them without wearing chip/cracker crumbs within the process.<br />Unfortunately, it cannot be found locally for us, so Amazon is our only option. (Love Amazon, they just seem to be out of stock on the Pepperoni Pizza ones more often than in stock, in all sizing options.) If they are in stock (or if you can find them locally), you should try them, they are well worth it!!"	0	0
1	B000YUOZU2	ALHREBN3EPQ4X	Excellent liquor flavor	I would recommend, given the Prime Shipping and the fact that no where in WI could I find true alcoholic (5%) liquor chocolates like this in time for Xmas. The best flavors are the orange Stoli vodka and the Grand Marnier, but that is IMHO.<br /><br />The batch I tasted a bit on the older side, otherwise I would have given this five stars. Despite that, I will DEFINITELY order these again. Cheers to Amazon for getting these on Prime in time for Santa!	2	0

-1	B002HFWN38	A9UI0NPHIDAF9	Love the Coffee, Hate the Package	My mom and I have been drinking this coffee for years and absolutely love it.  It is well-priced, tastes great, and it's easy to keep in the office to make at work - not to mention way less money than heading to a coffee shop.  BUT, I really hate the new packet format.  First of all, one packet really isn't enough for me for a good cup.  Second, they are annoying to open.  And most importantly, these are the opposite of environmentally friendly.  Why do we need all the excess packaging?<br /><br />Bring back the canisters!	6	2
-1	B001P3NU3U	A3GTNZZ9GKI5ZA	Ok, but my dog got tired of them quickly..	My dog seemed to love these when I got samples at the vet after her teeth cleaning. But then I bought an entire bag and she was over it, ha. I do really like the C.E.T. products since I have a small dog with bad teeth!! One caveat, they have this strong vitamin-like smell that lingers for a while. Suppose that is better smelling than those bully sticks!	0	0
1	B0045XE32E	A3T7V207KRDE2O	Taste great but too big and hard	These are great tasting dog treats but I don't like to spoil my puppies too much and would have preferred smaller pieces even for our Corgi. Our other puppy is about half his size. They are the hardest puppy treats we have tried so breaking them into smaller pieces isn't a simple task even for a man's hands. I was worried how tough they would be for our puppies to chew but they didn't complain. In fact, they took a bit more time and didn't inhale them which is a good thing!<br /><br />Another Newman's Own quality product.	0	0

I like to drain my tofu, slice it, marinate it, and then bake it (for use as part of a stir-fry.)  This particular type of tofu, however, is true to the ""silken"" variety.  If I were using it as part of a recipe that didn't require firmness as part of the equation, I'm sure it would be fine.  However, you have to be EXTRA cautious when handling the tofu because it is ""silken"" (and therefore a ton more fragile.)  In addition, if baked, it produces a very unappetizing, rubbery texture.  I didn't hate it, but I definitely won't be buying it again."	6	0

Not their fault, mine for not looking more closely.<br /><br />A little more Bad: Natural Balance appeared on my list of tainted pet foods and treats. I don't know if the lamb and rice treat was one of the banned items but, guess what?, the dogs doesn't get any more of it until I know for sure it's ok.<br /><br />If I ever get to a store that has it after the pet food scare is over I might pick up a few rolls.

1	B000EYRBSQ	A31ZOZWAIQ6YWT	Not good for a toddler	They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other brands of dried apples - crispy, but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler, but the pieces are big, hard, and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.<br /><br />On the bright side - they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself, they should work.	3	1

They taste very little like fruit and very much like sulfates and preservatives.  I would return them if I could, they aren't even palatable.  I tried to give them away for free and failed, the only way I might be able to choke these down would be in sugared oatmeal.  Not even space food, just definitely not food.	0	0
-1	B001EPPJVK	A2XRM4CCC56GFG	Good product, shipping disaster	"I ordered Osem Vegtable Soup Mix as an inexpensive replacement for the pricey vegetable soup mix packets from the grocery store that I normally use for Spinach Dip. As such, being yellow in color rather than brown, it has a different appearance than expected. [The picture on the label shows a brownish, beef-like broth, but that is not how it looks.] It also lacks the amount of dehydrated vegetables visible in the brands of instant vegetable soup I am familiar with. And yet the flavor is similar enough that it did work ""okay"" in the dips.<br /><br />The unexpected, bigger benefit, has been its use in gravies, cream sauces and homemade cream soups. It's become a very handy item to have around, adding a little ""something extra"" to the flavor of these other recipes. And if you happen to run out of milk to use in one of these you can still pull off a tasty cream sauce or soup since it is met to be made with just water.<br /><br />I opted for the ""subscription"" ordering system, scheduling a delivery of six containers every six months. The first time a shipment arrived, all was well. However, the second time, it was awful. Thank God the 6 containers were packed inside of a plastic bag, because the tops had separated in all but two of them. The whole red top part of each container had come off the yellow base. The interior foil seals, that line the containers at the top had also pulled loose. If not for the bag, the soup mix would have been all over the inside of the box.<br /><br />When I signed into my Amazon account to look up the phone number to complain, I was presented with a question regarding customer satisfaction with the shipping on the order. So I filled out the form submit, explaining what a mess that shipment had been. I have never received a reply of any kind. Either no one reads the information they solicit from customers or they don't care.<br /><br />That leaves me with a four star product [because it does not look like the beef broth appearance as shown on the label] and one star shipping experience, so I gave it a three star rating. I am undecided as to whether to cancel the subscription or not. The product is not quite what I expected and wanted for spinach dip use, but it has some other uses I had not anticipated that are worthwhile in their own way.  I had one good shipping experience and one that amounted to a lot of wasted product and no way to know what the norm is. If anyone else reviews this soup mix, I hope you'll comment on the condition it arrived in."	0	0
-1	B0073TSE7M	A18XBIP3VA2WZR	Not great.	The strawberry flavor rates a 2-3. The waxy mouthfeel of this chocolate gets a big thumbs down. Their Orange in Milk Chocolate was delicious. I am surprise that the same company puts out both products, they are that different.	0	0
-1	B00110JI4M	A10TYGME2FQHO7	A healthier option, but not great	"There's something off about the pasta. While much closer to the regular pasta than Whole Wheat, which is way to grainy, the pasta here tends to kind of fall apart (only way I can describe it). But from a health aspect its better than normal blue box mac and cheese. And the taste is comparable.<br /><br />I know this sounds horrible and a total waste of cash, but occationally I'll buy this, toss the pasta and replace it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00135XQCK"">Barilla Plus Penna Pasta~2pk~14.5oz Boxes~</a> which is 1000 times tastier than the pasta in this box, suffers none of the high grain of whole wheat, and is chock full of protein and Omega 3's, and overall healthier and more sustaining --  because its got protein.<br /><br />I keep wishing Kraft would just start selling the packets of cheese powder without the pasta (they do actaully <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1T6I"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Topper, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a>but its currently more expensive than just buying the box and tossing the pasta)."	1	1

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation. I've found it helps with both the cramps and mood swings of PMS, and even seems to lessen eye strain headaches. It's also proving invaluable as a way to counteract the rebound insomnia and moodiness of withdrawal from a prescription sleep medication. I take away one star (and would make that a half if I could), because in its raw form (or merely blended with water), it tastes terrible. But mixed with a sweet juice, it's decently palatable.	1	1

This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.

I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad.

-1	B001OCKIBY	AZAKCIFE27RAA	Very Tasty but......	You will pay for great taste with a high dose of fat and calories. These may not be the best choice for myself but are a very good option if trying to get some protein into your kids snacks. My family loved these and they were gone quickly. I believe they are a great lunchbox option and afterschool snack. They are much tastier than any granola bars on the market. Who doesn't like sweet and salty?	2	2
-1	B0001M0YI0	AENLD33KQ6MJ4	Superb Quality and Price, Though Not the Cheapest Around	A pound of crystallized ginger can be made to go a long way, and we made this pound last about 4-5 months by chopping the round slices into dices, transferring it to the freezer in resealable sandwich bags, then using it over time to make about 4 batches of Ginger Snap cookies.<br /><br />If you'd like to make more than that, or get more ginger for half the price, you'll want to checkout the 6-pounder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UXY2J2?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8) from Roland. Both are about equal as far as visual and cooking quality, but Roland is about half the cost per pound.<br /><br />Frontier's crystalized ginger was a bit stiff and woody, meaning it was likely left in the ground too long before harvested. While the cookie quality was decent, I wouldn't recommend it for raw consumption.<br /><br />Ideal ginger (crystallized or not) should be tender. Try the stuff from Australia (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G818BQ?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8) for some of the finest consumption-quality ginger around, but do know that it's spicy no matter the origin. (Hey, they don't call it a spice for no reason!)<br /><br />Hot Tip: Discovery Channel's Mythbusters proved that ginger is an exceptional remedy for motion sickness. It WORKED when practically no man-made remedy did! Amazing.	1	0

I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??

1	B004JRKEH4	A1KLPS6P7UR631	Great flavor and consistency	Chipotle is one of my favorite flavors, and this Taco Bell Chipotle sauce does not disappoint.  The sauce is more the consistency of mayo rather than the runny hot sauce consistency of other chipotle sauces I've tried, which made it a tad milder, and also helped keep it on the food instead of running off.  Obviously, it goes great on tex-mex food, but I also put it on a whopper and loved it.  How about getting this sauce in the restaurants?	0	0
-1	B000PWIR12	A37WMVOF3RVET	New and Improved Recipe anything BUT improved.	I have been eating this stuff since the '70s or shall I say HAD been. They now only have the New and Improved Recipe which is terrible!  I thought it went bad-- then I see on the box, new and improved. Who approved this. Anyone remember New Coke--- well, I see this happening again only with Quaker, Inc.  I will no longer buy this stuff until they go back to the old recipe.	0	0
1	B002WDCDDK	A2RHE9UV7IQEG0	Good basic coffee	"I like the Gevalia better than the Starbucks Caffe Verona my husband first bought me. The Starbucks is way too strong and bitter, in my opinion. However, I'm a ""foo-foo"" coffee lover, the more fancy the flavor the better. I like the Swiss Hazelnut as a basic coffee; although it's even a bit on the strong side, but not bad. I add the latte creamer or cappacino creamer to it...using a BIG cup."	1	0
-1	B001E5E29A	A1VRQ0TSYWLA1E	Not too impressed	Makes OKAY pancakes. Only marginally better than the standard Bisquick recipe. They are edible (I should say that my kids liked them).<br /><br />Not that great, in my opinion.	0	2

Peanut butter and chocolate with a crispy wafer texture.  OMG.  Instant love.  I originally tried these when they came out in 1998 or '99 and loved them, but then forgot about them for 10 years.  I just went and bought more at the grocery store, and fell in love all over again.<br /><br />If you like Reese's peanut butter cups and KitKats, try these, you won't be disappointed!"	3	0

This one tastes good as well. I'm not really sure about the sodium, perservatives etc. It's a fast meal so of course you will have those issues. I just need something quick to fix and this is it. I think I will try it without the sauce packet next time, I think it will taste better without it. (just the cheese packet)	0	0

-1	B006NGE1G4	A3F6UPPU8W8J0U	The other 3 flavors are much better	"At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, ""Caramel""). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar."	0	0
-1	B001PMDYV4	A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84	None of the five cats will eat it	"I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning ""I hate it."" I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means ""I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that ""I don'tlike it"" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them ""eat or not eat"" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular ""orange and white kitty"" and my ""sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'"" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where ""the special eating"" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever ""speciality of the evening"" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go ""aLookin"" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid ""nose sticker uppers."" But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole ""nother"" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by ""Cindy O"". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we ""come upon"" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried."	2	3

1	B00472I5A4	A3RMGIKUWGPZOK	Great Chip!	"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."	2	0
-1	B002IEZJMA	AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU	Not overly bitter like most espresso, but...	Let's face it, espresso is not for the casual coffee drinker.  It's highly concentrated, and generally tastes terribly bitter.  But I thought I'd give this illy drink a whirl anyway. It does seem a bit tame for espresso -- which is a good thing if you're not an aficionado; but for those who love espresso, this will likely be too dilute. I think illy's canned cappuccino drink tastes much better.  But I guess if you're a serious coffee drinker, having an espresso on the go like this would be a good thing.  I think the price is relatively fair considering the cost of packaging, manufacturing, distribution, et al, but at the end of the day, I still think it's far too steep a price for canned coffee.  Overall, it's just ok.	0	0

1	B001LG940E	A3KFIMCP87VH4U	Tastes like apple juice	Overall, Switch tastes just fine but the predominate flavor is really apple juice. In fact, the smell of apples greats your nose from the moment you take your fist taste. While the product seems to be a rather good one, especially since it consists of real fruit juices that that been carbonated, it fails on the account that it really does not taste like black cherry. The cost of this product (at nearly $1 for an 8.3 fluid ounce can) is also prohibitive. At this time, I can see myself purchasing it as it is far more economical to buy other fruit juices.	1	0

1	B001LG940E	A1BT6TL7UCIC5Y	Deceptively tasty	"Corn products of all types give me migraines, so I'm always looking for soda that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.  It's difficult to find regular soft drinks that don't contain corn syrup.  I decided to give The Switch a try because it contains ordinary sugar.<br /><br />I liked the taste of the Black Cherry Switch.  It tasted more like fruit punch than black cherry though.  This makes sense because cherries are at the bottom of the fruit ingredients list.  Apple juice comprises most of the fruit juice in Black Cherry Switch.  Marketing this as ""black cherry"" is a bit misleading.  They should call it carbonated ""fruit drink"" instead of ""black cherry.""  It annoys me when marketers employ deceptive advertising.<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy the taste.  I just recommend that people read the ingredients list before buying."	0	0

1	B004867T24	A2NUBL2UYWPBWR	Real tuna steaks.	These treats are real tuna steaks grilled and sliced into 3 strips.  There are no additives, no fillers, just real tuna packaged conveniently in a resealable pouch. (See photos above)<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1) My picky cat that doesn't like treats, loves these.<br />2) My picky dog that loves fish and who also thinks she's a cat, loves these<br />3) Since this is just pure tuna, it is safe for both cats and dogs.<br />4) Conveniently and attractively packed in a easy-tear, resealable pouch and is ideal for traveling or for gift giving.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The resealable pouch isn't completely leak-proof.<br />2) The resealable pouch was packaged with some tuna juice on the outside of the seal and so when opening, tuna juice gets everywhere.<br />3) Expensive.  This is basically a slice of tuna steak in water, so a comparable product would be chunk light tuna canned in water at a 1/6 the price.  I doubt that whether the tuna is grilled or not would make a difference to the animals.<br />4) As this is an actual tuna steak sliced into 3, the teats are hard to break into smaller bite-sized pieces that one would give their cat or dog.  It needs to be additionally cut into smaller pieces by fork and knife or with scissors.<br /><br />Overall a healthy treat that is minimally processed.  Although expensive, it would make an ideal gift or special occasion treat.	0	1

-1	B003DA54ZA	AA7BA08M0YZR2	My Chihuahua died of Melamine poisoning after eating a chicken chew	"My Chihuahua, Chiquita, loved those Hartz chicken chews and it never occurred to me that she would one day die as a result of eating those chicken chews.  I used to give her those chews a few times a week throughout her entire life, then one day when she was 15 years old she got real sick right after I had given her one of those chicken chews, and she was lethargic.  I took her to the vet and they said she had developed Kidney Failure.  That was the beginning of the end for her.  The results were from the Hartz chicken chew that I had given her...and it was Melamine Poisoning.  In back of the Hartz package it says, ""Made in China.""  If you are reading this, you may want to read the following website from the FDA:<br />[...]<br />Chiquita died from Kidney Failure, and all it took was one Hartz chicken chew that had Melamine to destroy her kidneys...and it came from China.

-1	B0006345PW	A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW	Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more	"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."	18	6
1	B007FRD47C	A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M	Nice Bold Earthy Flavor!	"I absolutely LOVE this tea! From the minute I first smelled its earthy, nutty scents (with hints of tobacco and leather), I knew it would be a delightful morning tea. I couldn't have been more right. For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I've experienced (without the bitterness of many ""bold"" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!"	8	0
1	B00430EJR8	A1POZH3XG8HLIZ	Nothing I tasted can compare...	"I have been on this journey to find healthy alternative(s)for quite some time.  I was reading in a book about flushing the fat and this was the only substitute recommended; so I went to whole foods the next day hoping that they carried the product ""stevia plus"".  Although, the label did not specify that it was the ""plus"" version - I took a chance to purchase it.  Now, I'm so glad that I did.  I'm very impressed by it's flavor.  I had tried a few other stevia products but the taste was unbearable.  This is my first review, so I hope someone can appreciate this recommendation."	16	0
-1	B005GTWCTM	ATN552TF5V40Z	Not as robust as Cafe Bustelo	From the other reviews I thought this would be at least as full flavored as Cafe Bustelo but it's not. It's more mild and I prefer a deeper stronger coffee flavor. I do like the creamy texture of this coffee but not enough to switch to it. I may try other varieties by Lavazza since it gets such good reviews all the time.	0	0

-1	B004779XSM	A3RQORQUDP9U7T	Unimpressed	We originally purchased this blend because my wife was a big fan of the Green Mountain French Vanilla blend, mixed with a caramel creamer.  We had hoped that this blend would have a similar flavor, but it didn't.<br /><br />We've tried numerous Green Mountain blends.  This one was definitely the least impressive of the bunch (so far).  The flavor isn't bad by any means -- it's certainly drinkable -- but it feels like it's missing something, especially when compared against other K-cups in the same price range.<br /><br />For comparison's sake: Our K-cup blends so far are the GMC Breakfast Blend, the French Vanilla blend, and Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee blend.  If you're looking for something a little darker, Emeril's Big Easy Bold blend is also very nice.	0	0

-1	B000E123M8	A2DXABSJPRI8CQ	Not the best	I previously read submitted reviews, and I should have listened.  Especially to the one that stated he didn't get the organic product shown in the picture.  I too did not get the organic product.  I have seen it in the stores, and it has a much lower sodium content per serving.  I haven't been able to find it in a while so I thought I would buy it through Amazon.<br /><br />The product was the old stuff with an expiration date of 6 months from now.  Usually the product in the store carries and expiration date of a year, so that tells you something right away.<br /><br />The noodles are okay.  My family is not that particular, so it's a good side dish on ocassion.  If you are an expert on peanut noodles, this dish is not for you.  It's slightly gummy and thick.	2	2

"These are sweet, delicious, addictive and quite expensive at approximately $5 per piece.<br />The apricot flavor is explosive and natural tasting to me.<br />I disagree with the reviewer who said they are ""artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture."" The chocolate is dark chocolate, not milk chocolate, and it does appear to have a higher cocoa butter content to make it more firm on the moist apricot, but I would not describe it as ""waxy"".<br />I highly recommend these as an occasional indulgence."	0	0

1	B00412W76S	A1JTAI1CD99Z9X	Birthing Miracle Tea	I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.	3	0

-1	B003C1HKV6	AO442HDU24KVQ	Salt block is ok in itself but mine came banged up...	They packed the block in tons of bubble wrap and related materials, but it needs something more or different.  The block weighs a lot and salt is fragile, a terrible combination for shipping.  So I would be shocked if almost anyone receives an undamaged block (at least with the packing used on mine).  The block itself is pretty nice.  It has the general colors and patterns you see in the photos, but since you will use it laying on a counter, there's no light source behind it, so it looks very flat and uninteresting compared to the photos shown on Amazon.  It looks a lot like soapstone or alabaster do when they aren't illuminated from behind.<br /><br />So you should expect that the corners will be smashed up and not very attractive, but other than that it should work fine if your primary purpose is to cook on it.	2	0

-1	B0017U7TFG	A3NI0HY6FKENYC	Ok, if you use the directions from one of the others.	Though not my favorite this is ok, great for those on diets where you need to limit Sodium, fat and etc. My recommendation though is you follow the instructions that were on a different flavor. After following the initial instructions instead of letting it sit after stirring, microwave at 20% power for an addt'l 5 mins. The flavors meld better and the pasta is a much better texture.	2	0

1	B00438XVGU	A3GTBL2BD7VEUM	Starbucks Via - Just like a cup of fresh Starbucks!	My husband and I have been coffee drinkers for many years.  We have bought and brewed just about all of the best coffees out there, including Starbucks whole beans.  We tried instant coffee, the usual brands to see if we could tolerate it, instead of waiting and watching the percolator, so it would'nt boil over on the stove.  The usual brands were tolerable.  That was until we tried the real deal...Starbucks Via Ready Brew Coffee.  I'd say that it is just about the best cup of coffee from Starbucks ever!	1	0
-1	B0016FY6H6	A37Y0WULUM9IJ5	Don't bother	"I bought this ""flavor"" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this."	0	2
-1	B005VOOM2W	AG90OGHDGOOVH	Ho, Hum	Conveniently single cup packaging, perfect for traveling, smells great when you unseal the foil packet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. The down side is that the packaging is appropriate for 'pod' brewing only and ends up brewing a pretty weak cup of coffee at that (maybe I'm biased, since I tend to brew Gevalia Dark Roast at about 7-8 scoops per 12 cup pot). I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)	2	2
-1	B001M09BHU	A10PXL1O1G6N28	Misleading about ingredients	"I first purchased this product because I love the flavored oatmeal that Quaker makes, but found the packets too sweet for my taste and too high of a sugar content for a healthier diet. I was really excited to find the lower sugar instant oatmeal until I noticed that they contain artificial sweeteners to compensate for the reduced sugar. As someone who deliberately avoids ""low fat"" and ""diet"" products to keep artificial sweeteners out of my body, it made me mad that they did not make it more clear that this was not a less sweet version of their product, but simply an artificially sweetened one. I just feel that people should be properly warned that the food they are purchasing contains chemical sweeteners, and wanted to let anyone thinking of purchasing this know. If you don't mind artificial sweeteners, then enjoy!"	37	6
-1	B000LKVL16	A1J1WODSG2NFCG	made in Taiwan?	I bought this without realizing that it is a product of Taiwan.  Considering all the health risks from eating foods made in China, I don't think I can trust the ingredients used in this product.  As I understand, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, all import many food ingredients from China, and they have found many harmful chemicals in them (I am not even including those that are unsanitary, i.e. made from sewer water).  So what guarantee is there that this product do not contain carcinogens or other harmful chemicals?

1	B002V28R6Y	A17N6MNN6HVHEX	The best Kitten food!	I have been feeding this food to my Ragdoll kittens/cats for years. The Blue Buffalo Spa Selects are the best food I have found for my kitties. I have one that has a sensitive stomach and will not keep any grain foods down. With Blue Buffalo Kitten, she has never gotten sick and loves it! I have Tom that was frequently getting urinary crystals. He hated the Hills Prescription Diet A/D food the vet wanted him to eat, canned or dry, but this stuff he loves. Kittens have grown strong and healthy with beautiful coats!<br />I have noticed also, for anyone considering switching to this food versus most others, because this food is very digestible, they eat less of it, process more of it, and actually seem to use the catbox less! With other grainy foods, they have trouble processing the cornmeal and it just passes through the system, creating more bowel movements, and eating more food. You can even SEE, if you look, the grains in my cats' stool with other brands compared to grain-free brands.<br />This at least is the case with my cats.	0	0

-1	B0002HDM06	A1K8AQTSPVQ17Q	Good, but not what I was hoping for.	I have long been a fan of Baklava.  Of course, everyone has their own idea of what constitues good baklava, and there are regional differences.  The best baklava I've had was when I was in Athens. Athens baklava was moist (not crispy) with plenty of dripping syrup and a hint of honey; there were 3 layers of nuts which were firm but not crunchy and there were subtle overtones of cinnamon and allspice (I think) and a hint of citrus zest. Fabulous!<br />This Shatila Mediterranean-Mideast baklava is disappointing: the single nut layer is moist, but the philo layers are crispy and mostly dry but have a strong butter-like flavor, and a greasy consistency (a-la butter flavored crisco?) There is a single layer of nuts which lacks spice or complex flavors...mostly just nutty; it is mildly sweet, less so than most baklava; no real syrup to speak of...just tastes sweet without even a hint of honey.  It tastes ok, but not what I was hoping for.  Seems fresh, and delivery was quick. Just my 2 cents.	3	0

I originally tried the white christmas tea at my neighborhood farmer's market during the holidays, but haven't been able to find it since (except for on Stash's website, where the shipping is pretty pricey). So, I got this brilliant idea to try to find it on amazon, and lo and behold, here it is! Shipping was reasonable, and I received it within a week. One thing I noticed that I think they could have done better with was the packing of the tea. The individual tea bags are sealed of course, but they were all scattered about inside the box. One thing I did like also is the fact that the expiration/use by date was clearly stamped on the outside of the box. It's always good to know you're getting a fresh product. All in all, I would say this is a good, reasonable way to purchase hard to find teas.	0	0

There is no ""one brand"" that meets everybody's preferences. Some are naturally sweeter than others. This is one of the coconut waters that rate high on the natural sweetness scale. For me, it is exactly what I wanted and could not be more pleased with the quality and taste of this coconut water.

Honestly, there are some bites I take which remind me of dog food.  I know we are talking about meat sticks here and not fine dining, but the texture of these is just not right, almost too granular.  I know Slim Jims have that greasy taste but these guys have a bit of it too and I have to admit I kind of enjoy it.

The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.

-1	B000LKUAKY	AMRAB7YXNYUPE	not like jerky	"i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days. granted, my memory is likely hazy as i haven't eaten meat for about 20 years. however, this stuff is NOT like beef jerky. true, they are a bit hard and chewy. and they are very flavourful, but....in my opinion, not in a good way.<br /><br />if you have ever had those dehydrated soy slices made by ""so soya"" (and others) then you know what these are. take those slices, marinade and fry or bake, and you've probably got something like this jerky. they have a distinct flavour - i really can't pinpoint exactly what flavour it is, but it is consistent in all of the varieties and it is not too pleasant. i found the tofurky jerky to have a better flavour and nicer dense texture, but i think my search for the ideal jerky shall continue."	0	0

1	B004770O08	A34DDHXIY8JNZO	Great tasting easy to use coffee	I've heard others who don't like Keurig coffee but I really find it to be some of my favorite and with these cups quite easy to make and quick too. All the flavors are subjective and for me I haven't found any I don't like. I'm the type of coffee drinker who likes coffee shop coffee and not really fond of Star B. if that helps. So if your taste is similar you should like this too.	0	0
1	B000COF1PI	A3VVOOWJLMQHLW	Cats crazy about these	Based on my experience with our six cats, I can't imagine any cat not devouring these. We have a cat with hyperthyroidism who needs a pill twice a day. Two of our other cats routinely run over when its pill time to see if I'll give them a tiny piece of the pill pocket, and the other three non-medicated cats would readily gobble these up too if I let them. Not to mention the cat who is supposed to be getting them. She's normally a whiner (unusual in cats) but loves these and readily takes them twice a day. Before now, we've had cats for many years and periodically had to give one of them pills; this is by far the easiest method I've run across. Good thing if one has have to give a cat pills as frequently as twice every day, indefinitely.	0	0
1	B0061JW7I2	AS9ETYMAC07N4	tasty!	I got a really good deal of this item in amazon.<br />Amazon provides must cheaper price than local stores.<br />The noodle includes two separate soup powders that make the taste so amazing.	2	1
-1	B001VIY8BW	A2501MPOL467D6	Terrible ingredients but my cat did eat it.	"Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so ""light"" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer."	0	1

I was expecting the same quality as Whole Foods (my mistake) but when I opened the bag, it looked like someone had taken a pear slice and crumbled it like a paper ball and dried it.<br /><br />We got this to have healthy snacks on hand but no one in my house can get over that slight ""ick"" taste and no one will eat it.

First of all, I really like this dog food because the first ingredient is real beef, not grains or gluten.<br />Second, the meat has a really interesting texture - like a cross between beef jerky and a puffed snack.  The vegetables are like regular dog kibble.<br />Third, my dog really loves this!  We have a 13 pound dog and the pieces aren't too big for him.  Usually he gets tired of his dog food after a while, but so far he still loves this food!  Unfortunately he keeps begging for it when it isn't time to eat, haha...<br />I would definitely order this food for our dog again.	0	0

-1	B002SOR6UI	A1HTIOUFEYIZOC	Buyer Beware!	Three and half years ago one of our dogs was diagnosed w/ IBS. We tried every diet, medication and supplement and nothing worked until last year when we discovered Wellness Simple Solutions Lamb and Rice, which is a single protein diet. We used the canned food and the kibble. Even our vet was impressed with his progress. Our now 11-year-old dog was now living a healthy life and he no longer suffered between constipation, diarrhea and hot spots.<br /><br />Several weeks ago all it returned, then suddenly disappeared only to return again.<br /><br />At the same time we noticed that some of the canned food had a different color and smell. I called the company and told them how he was reacting and asked them if they had changed the recipe and they said they had.  Towards the end of the conversation the rep asked me to read her the numbers on the bottom of the cans. She then asked me to return certain marked cans because they accidently mislabeled them! They were not the Lamb and Rice single protein food. She also offered a refund for the unused cans.<br /><br />The FedEx box arrived in a heartbeat, no letter of apology and no refund.<br /><br />What is even more troubling is the fact that this large corporation, to my knowledge has made no effort to let their customers know of this error. I'm truly concerned that there are others who use this product and are now dealing with what our dog has had to deal with for the past several weeks, not knowing they are feeding their dog mislabeled food.	0	1

"Got a chance to try these Newman's Own Organic Pomegranate Licorice Twists and I have to say that I enjoyed them, but I didn't love 'em.  I've never been a huge fan of the ""red"" licorices, finding them a bit bland and much more plastic-y than your standard black anise licorice, and these certainly fall into that camp.  I was expecting more of  a burst of pomegranate flavor, but it's rather subtle unless you really keep it in your mouth and savor it.  Actually the flavor builds with the more you eat, and you taste it more on the back end as an aftertaste."	0	0

Hailing from Kelheim, Germany,  this 8.2% ABV wheat doppelbock ale has been one of my favorites for nearly a decade.  Semi-opaque with a medium brown color, this German ambrosia has a full bodied Bavarian flavor that quickly permeates the senses.  Out of all of the wonderful beer offerings from Germany, Aventius continues to be my favorite.  Oddly, however, it's really only existed on the marginal fringe (at least in MPLS) of the German beer universe.  Maybe this is a good thing; I would hate to see this ale ruined by some soulless entity like InBev.<br /><br />If you like German beer, please try this one.	0	0

-1	B0019H0YZ4	A2R1PS40MI7Q9T	Not as good as you would think.  It IS a true toddler formula.  Not recommended for new infants	"I was sold on this formula for a few reasons. Some are true, some need further investigation.<br /><br />I was only going to feed my newborn organic, so I looked at the choices:<br /><br />Earth's Best (made by Hain Celestial)<br /><br />Baby's Only<br /><br />Similac Organic<br /><br />I ruled out Sililac right away because the FIRST ingredient is CANE SUGAR. This is a very cheap way to introduce carbs into the formula. I firmly believe that Sugar is the culprit of many our ails as a society today...Including the out of control type 2 diabetes in children under 18. The last thing I wanted to do was to feed my child ""fast food"" formula. Organic or not.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the Earth's Best and the Babys Only. In reading the Baby's Only website, I liked a couple of things that they stated...(which really were knocks against Earth's Best). One was that the cows used for the dairy for Baby's Only were small run family cows and that these farms commitment to organic farming and practices were sound. As opposed to Earth's Best which sourced its milk from Horizon who is owned by the Huge food processor Dean Foods. Dean is one of the largest milk producers in the country. The Baby's Organic people insinuated that cows from Dean are not treated well and may not be truely organic like their cows due to watered down USDA regulations. Maybe true, maybe not. They would like you to believe this because it supports their product. Truth be told, Horizon is the largest purchaser of small run , family farm milk in the country. It is estimated that half to 3/4 of their milk supply is obtained this way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bothered me is that Baby's Organic claims that their Carbohydrate source is superior. They use brown rice syrup which they claim breaks down slower because it is a more complex sugar, thus lowering the ""spiking"" of insulin levels. Now, whereas I believe that compared to Cane sugar or corn syrup, this is a no brainer, I would choose brown rice syrup....but here's where I think that they are totally wrong. Earth's Best uses Lactose as their primary sugar (carb source). In human breast milk, lactose is almost the exclusive source for carbs...exactly the same as Earth's Best. Again on the Baby's Only website they claim lactose to be inferior to their brown rice syrup. How can they do this?? They show no evidence to support their claim, especially when Lactose is what's in breast milk!!<br /><br />The reason I bring this point up is because I did not know all of this and I fed my baby Babys Only from weeks 2-6 of her life believing their website that brown rice is better. She had SOOOO much gas...burping, flatulation...she was so uncomfortable using this formula...we switched to Earth's Best and all of the problems went away. I really think that the brown rice syrup used is much harder for the baby to digest and thus messes up their fragile systems. Lactose is the same ingredient found in human breast milk. I cannot understand how the Baby's Only people can deny this. They are the only formula maker that I have found that stands by the claim that brown rice us better than lactose.<br /><br />Furthermore, they call it a Toddler Formula and maybe for a good reason. I read in a few places that Whereas all of the nutrients are the same as infant formulas, they called it toddler because they wanted to be politically correct by stating that all babies under 12 months should breast feed. But, now with experience I do not think that it is as well tolerated as other infant formulas because of their ingredient choice."	90	14
-1	B000FFS0CA	AXO4PQU0XG3TG	$43.20 for 48 buds but only one bud is tasty and nice to look at	I suggest ordering the pack with the small glass teapot with one each of 9 different flowering teas first.  Two disk and two balls are packed in each small box.  The ball ones open up in a cuter way.  They should steep longer to get the best flavor out of them but by that time, the tea will have cooled  considerably.  Of the four types, I only liked the taste of the ball with the red blossom.  None of them bloomed as prettily as other brands I have tried.	3	4

-1	B001M23VEW	A2F18MUBQWP69O	not good...	The spices were accurate if a little cheap tasting. The tea type is wrong, thai iced tea is not made with green tea. The orange food dye seemed a little much. When I brewed the tea it made my entire house smell terrible for the entire day. It is cheap but I dont think I will even brew another batch. I would rather pay 2.50 at the thai restaurant nearby.	5	1
1	B004OQLIHK	A2IOL6T3XRF27	Perfect!	When I was in high school, my mother would always have these around the house. Living in the dorms, I usually only ever find small, overpriced packages of chocolate covered rasins. This is perfect for satisfying my cravings! It stores very well - I've had mine about a month and they taste the same as when I first opened them - delicious!	2	0
1	B007TGDXMK	A2GP1ZZNVZLF9	A different way to brew	The cups are different. They have a paper filter that doesn't get punched like regular K Cups.In my opinion they make much better coffee than the others. Rainforest blend is my favorite,but the other blends are good too.	0	0

-1	B00020XNUC	A7XO1DM6W3DOS	Average chocolate, strong fillings	"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier."	9	11

With Splenda no less!  I'm hooked.  I haven't gotten around to it yet, but I bet it would taste good as a caramel substitue in desserts too.	0	0
-1	B00474OR8G	A2708XMGVXIHJ4	Odd Taste	I got this in a sampler package.  I won't be buying it again.  It had a sort of stale taste, like coffee that has been sitting in a pot for hours.  I like fairly strong coffee. Coffee People Donut Shop for example.  But this doesn't come close.  It's not weak, just stale.  And no, it wasn't even close to the expiration date.	0	1

1	B000F409HU	AYB4ELCS5AM8P	Excellent strong tea!	"Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it. Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, cheap teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, this is what I imagine Homer's nectar of the gods to be like. It's like Zeus brews me a cup, hands it over and says ""here, drink this"".<br /><br />So far I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. A 10/10."	7	0
-1	B006N3I69A	AZHSO1XRV44V1	Undrinkable	This coffee was undrinkable.  In fact, it could hardly be described as coffee.<br /><br />However, I contacted Amazon to complain and to see if I could return my unopened packages (I had ordered two).  They responded by saying that I couldn't return food items, but that they would credit my account anyway.  What fantastic customer service.  It's that kind of response that keeps me coming back to Amazon for the best deals and the best service!	0	0
-1	B0005Z83E0	AYHANBLNNN9OF	Beautiful color	I have used Hershey for flavor which has been fine but I will keep searching for the perfect chocolate.<br />Ghirardelli is dutched and a beautiful reddish color. It is very bland and has very little cocoa flavor.I expected<br />much more from them.  I used to spend many afternoons at Ghirardelli Square drooling over their chocolate candy and<br />it is superb. But, this cocoa is way overpriced and I had to use several teaspoons just to make a good cup of cocoa.<br />Save your money and get cocoa from your supermarket for baking and drinking.  This Ghirardelli cocoa would be good as<br />a decorative cocoa on top of cakes, pears,cookies, pies or other dessert.	1	0
1	B001EQ5PD6	A1HQJTT3FH9RPB	Great price for this many fish!	I have a sister who is crazy about Swedish fish, so I decided to get her a 1 gallon candy jar and fill it with fish for her birthday.  I wasn't sure how many fish it would take to fill a gallon jar, so I went with this package, thinking that it should at least fill most of it.  I was pleasantly surprised when the fish arrived and just one of the two included bags was enough to fill the jar almost entirely!  I was able to give my sister the full jar with a nicely packaged refill.  I'll most likely be buying this package again in the future, great bang for the buck.	0	0
1	B0018CE7BC	AAU3TOHIK4552	Superb, top of the line dry dog food	I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.	1	0
-1	B000CQE3HS	A21VNZ2V2RJSH6	Poor Shelf Life!	Don't buy these for your BoB. I just got mine and they expire in July. I assumed they had enough salt to draw in deer but apparently they've discovered a new process for rendering salt useless in preservation.	1	0
-1	B004U43ZO0	A3PWPNZVMNX3PA	Too Sweet and Artificial	When Chips Ahoy! first came on the scene when I was young, I thought they were a good cookie that was always soft and a good balance of cookie to chocolate chip ratio. Since then, they have come up with variants on the initial blend to keep people interested and aware of the Chips Ahoy! brand line. Now they introduce Chips Ahoy! Chewey Gooey Chocofudge. Do I like it? Not really. Maybe its with age or refined taste or my lack of interest in snacks and sweet foods in my older years, but I found this cookie very sweet. Not just in the chocolate chips, but the cookie itself seemed very sugary. Also, in addition to the many chocolate chips, it looks like they baked one giant chip smack in the middle to ensure every bite gets a chocolaty taste. So it seems overkill on the sweetness factor. And because this is a cookie that is manufactured by food scientists to ensure sameness in every cookie, it ended up tasting on the artifical side. Perhaps these would taste better fresh out of an oven and have a warm taste, but that is a preference for the individul to determine. But they are not sold that way, so I am taking it as it is given. So will I buy these? No. I dont buy the ones I grew up with, so I definitely will not get these either.	0	1
1	B001E6EJX8	AJHH59ALYINWZ	Really great protein bar	I unfortunately work in a job setting where we do not just get to take breaks when we feel like it or snack while working. This can be a problem for me, as I tend to get hungry every two hours and sometimes only get a 10 minute break. These bars are small enough to eat quickly and keep me full til I can have a real meal. They are tasty too!  A bit like a chocolatey rice crispy bar. Only downside is price. On sale they work out to be about a dollar a bar, which is about the same as most protein bars, I just wish I didn't have to resort to an extra $20 a month protein bar to keep my stomach happy.	1	0
-1	B005BV1TVM	A3HIYJP0RMSLK6	Not the same as store-bought	"Our dog loves these things. We've been buying them at our local grocery store for years. When I saw them in bulk here, I jumped at the chance to save some money. Unfortunately, the ""chicken"" is not the same as contained in the store-bought four-packs. Our little buddy tried one, left it, and never finished another. Note, the chicken is a darker red color in these than the store-bought packs. I felt misled since the description matched what we previously purchased in the store."	0	0
1	B000084F44	A191G1FA15CD1I	Excellent Treat - You can't go wrong with these!	My dog (and every other dog I know) loves these treats.  They are small enough for small dogs as a treat, and serve as great training treats for larger dogs.  Not messy, no residue, etc.  For small dogs, won't make them gain weight and won't spoil dinner for them.  You can't go wrong with these!	3	0
1	B000LLXBKY	AK8LOFYRZJJW0	A must have for gluten free baking.	I use Mochiko in my gluten free flour mix.  It adds a bit of body and chewiness to cookies and brownies.

-1	B003M61F4E	AY1FDSR4VQ8LT	My dogs got sick off a bag,and cost me 300$ in vet bills	I have been feeding this brand to my bulldogs for 2 years.  Petco stop carring it, so I have been buying from Amazon.  I buy two 30lb bags at a time.. I never thougth it would make by bulldogs sick.  I stop feeding them from that bag, and opened the new one after I had taken them to the vet and they eventually got better.  I ran out of the 2nd bag  so I put them back on original bag, and they started vomiting again..It's hard to see my pupps so sick, and don't know if I should keep buying this brand.	1	3
-1	B003A23HZK	A1JTDDKNYKJ9NP	Not impressed	My 8 month old labradoodle prefers the one that is round (another brand). The square design on this one makes him scoot it around which seems to lose his interest rather quickly. Plus it's rather noisy.	1	0

I will buy one again in the future.	1	0
-1	B00004RBDU	A20CD16YE6J61C	Mediocre	"Ok..it works to a certain degree, no doubt about it. However..what you get for your money is a plastic container, under dollar store's quality, a small lightbulb and a gluepad. At 3.95 this might be priced right, but thats the price of the gluepads alone (which will dust in and get covered with cathair in a veru short time)(which were warped and bent and dont sit right in the plasic container because they lack a way to attach them firmly to the groiund). Or just build it yourself, should be possible too.<br />On a sidenote: Laughing about the guy that ""caught 10000 fleas"" with it. Oh I see him sitting there, his gluepad on his lap, counting the fleas on it..for 2-4 days. How much did you get paid for that review?"	1	0

1	B0061IUKDM	A1AES697PC2IW5	Excellent BALANCED Green Tea +++	"I just had a big hot cup of this fine green tea. Higgins & Burke have an unsually balanced green tea via this special variant -- balanced very well via addition of some lemon grass, lemon balm herb and verbena leaves -- spot-on to balance-out any harsh bitterness that some green teas have. Yet it is very much a mellow ""sweet"" ""premium"" Sencha green tea -- and neither too strong nor too weak -- after a full three minutes brewing under boiling water poured  over two bags of this green into my large cup. So I like this green -- even tho I usually like black, amber or white teas for being less bitter -- and must balance usual green teas via adding my own lemon, orange or mint. When I do have this tea via my own blend with orange black tea and some mint [and iced] -- it is very good indeed -- BUT I am impressed that this green tea is so good hot with adding just some brown sugar +++"	0	0

(There's nothing wrong with my oven, the temp was fine).<br /><br />And it should be noted that this product contains Maltitol. This ingredient causes diarrhea and gas- BIG time.

-1	B006ZZC0FW	A1G6Q2NQMJ2C3X	What's with Amazon's prices?	I last bought this in May 2011, for around $26.  I used to get it for around $17 on Subscribe and Save, before Amazon ended that option.  I had to stop buying all my k-cups from amazon, because the big warehouse club has an 80-pack of Donut House and Caribou blend varieties for $33.  I first thought it was just the coffee product that amazon was having pricing issues with, but their prices seem to be inflating across the board, while their competitors are not reflecting the same sort of steep increases.  I've found myself going to v*t*c*st.com for many of the repetitive grocery items that I used to order through amazon.  The main difference I can see is that amazon's competitors don't have to worry about pleasing Wall Street, so their prices are kept more honest.<br /><br />Italian Blend coffee is a decent mild coffee, my wife's favorite.  We'll keep ordering it, but it won't be from amazon.	0	0

-1	B004Q3LBTG	AGSEQ3BY9I5P0	Food NOT smooth at all!!!	I was super excited to get this since I was putting my veggies in a steamer basket in a pan on the stove top. Steaming the veggies and then putting them into the blender to make them into baby food. I though GREAT!! I can save time, dishes and frustration all with this machine. Not so much. This machine does not make smooth baby food no matter how much you let the steamer go. So, I was steaming in this and transfering to a blender to puree. I will be sending this back. Keep your money and take the extra minute to transfer the food from your steamer to your blender!	0	3
1	B008RWB8MW	A2PN55MTK1BIL5	Perfect!	"These Elk Splits are the perfect chew for any dog. They have no discernible odor to humans, yet my dog knew exactly what to do with it. Unlike commercially sold bones, this has no grease to mess up carpets or flooring. It does not splinter, so it is good for small or large dogs. These come not split for larger dogs, but I have found that the split antlers are best for my 20 pound puppy. He got his first split antler when he was only 5 pounds, and knew what to do with it, and loved it. Helped through the teething stage. Bought one for every room, and when he went after something, or me, to chew on, I would distract him with his antler. It worked! These are supposedly humanely ""found"" as deer and elk shed their antlers every year. I hope this is true, as you can't believe everything you read on the internet, but it does make sense! As they can make money doing nothing but finding cutting, and bagging these to sell. They aren't cheap, but they do last a long time. After the marrow has been chewed out, the antler can still be gnawed on, and will harmlessly flake off, and like bone, can be eaten. When the antler gets smaller, it should be replaced with a new one, as it could be swallowed whole in a smaller size. These have lasted for weeks! So the expense in my mind is well worth it. They do sell it by the weight of the dog, but use your common sense. A smaller one is not going to be any softer, than a larger one. The larger one will last longer than a smaller one, as long as it is not so large that the dog can't pick it up and carry it around. Hope these are around for a very long time."	0	0
1	B0005XO85A	A1976OLTOZ8D19	Always in stock at my house!	Every time I make a key lime pie I use Nellie and Joe's lime juice.  People RAVE about it every single time.  I've been asked to BBQs and asked to bring two pies.  Both pies were gone before other desserts were even touched.  I tried this product one winter in New England when fresh key limes were simply not available (for less than $50 special order)- so to have found this was a pleasant surprise.  Make the recipe on the bottle- use a pre-made graham cracker crust if you must or make your own, which is so much better and easy enough to do, then top with homemade whipped cream.  People will LOVE it!  I live in California now and can easily get key limes but still use Nellie and Joes for pies because it's so easy.  Enjoy!	0	0

1	B003ULDZ80	A1VVXNT5QLVSJ4	Worth trying	This tea has a smooth, well rounded flavor and goes very well with steamed milk. I drink tea all day, and Earl Grey is my go to black tea. Earl Grey is great black, and a bit of extra dark chocolate on the side is better. Nothing breaks a hot day, or tension like a good tea. This tea has an aroma that pulls. Of the many brands out there this is definitely in my top 5(like #4 or maybe 3), because of the consistency in flavor, good selection, and the company mantra doesn't hurt either. I generally let this tea steep much longer than other brands, because it just doesn't get bitter. My wife got me hook on Earl Grey lattes, and everyone I've offered it to. If you're looking to try something new or a different brand, Numi is well worth a try. And if you've never had the latte it's: a splash of hot water, tea, vanilla syrup (I like just a shot for 16 to 20 oz, but the amount's up to you), and fill with hot milk.	4	1

-1	B004051BLS	A299RHMH1M9PIW	Another Take on Mint	"You might think I wasn't too thrilled when you see three out of five possible stars. This is, however, a truly delightful mint tea. There are so many varieties of mint tea out there that this didn't seem to me a groundbreaking new tea release. The idea of a revitalizing mint tea is rather original. If that is what you are looking for you can knock this rating a star or two higher. Of course, in my personal opinion, mint is a tea for relaxing rather than revitalizing. That is my opinion. I do enjoy the taste of this tea which isn't completely a pure mint flavor but rather a ""minty"" flavor.  If you like mint tea you will enjoy this tea as well. Yogi's quality is well known. If you are looking to revitalize, so much the better. This guy is looking to relax. It's just a personal preference... truly."	0	0
1	B002VRJ2CM	A32VA0MEO89A26	Great for training!	My dogs love these training treats.  I break them up even smaller to use as rewards.  They are soft which I like when training.

-1	B000UBH9YE	A36PG3D7ILZEU2	Yuck!  And if you are gluten intolerant, be wary!	Okay, people.  I just don't get it!  How can this stuff be getting five stars from so many people?  Do they know what coffee is SUPPOSED to taste like?  Yuck, yuck, and double YUCK!  This is akin to drinking dirty water!  I've even doubled the pods to try to get a richer cup...to no avail.  What taste it has is horrible...not that there is much taste at all!  I will struggle through this case and never buy it again!  All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or evening...a GOOD cup of decaf!  Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so!  I wouldn't recommend this stuff to my worst enemy!  Again, I say YUCK!<br /><br />Also, my tummy's reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the pods...perhaps in the glue?  I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they wouldn't give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME!  Forget it!  That made me even more suspect!<br />I can't say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere.  It is only a suspicion created by an all too familiar IBS reaction.<br /><br />Buy this stuff at your own risk, or, if you enjoy drinking weak coffee that looks and tastes like dirty water.	0	3

Wellll....ignorance is bliss folks.  Turns out we've all been drinking the kool-aid on this one, because even though it is marketed as a better choice than processed sugar, it actually has a worse effect on your blood levels than High Fructose Corn Syrup.

If you prefer your margaritas with a little more crisp lime-y bite, give this one a pass. I tried it mixed with water and served over ice. Maybe try mixing it with ice in a blender? I'm too lazy to get the blender out for a quick drink and always drink my Margaritas on the rocks.<br /><br />I have also tried the Target 5-calorie Market Pantry on-the-go drink mix in Lime Margarita. It's more transparent (which seems less disturbing somehow) and comes with recipe enhancers right on the box. For example, add fresh lime juice. There's even a recipe for a full fledged Margarita.<br /><br />In comparison, I found the Crystal Light lacking: too artificial tasting with a less than appealing color.<br /><br />PS. For my second batch, I added 1/2 cup of fresh lime juice. I thought that helped, but the only way my husband would drink it was if he dumped in a bunch of grenadine. Also, when the pitcher was empty I noticed that the product left behind a noticeable chalky white substance on the bottom of the pitcher. We won't be finishing off the rest of the mix.	0	0

This time I've tried the Peach Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, and yum...it takes a bit of fiddling, but once you get it right, it is delicious. A welcome addition to any collection! And keep in mind that I'm still new to matcha and trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />As any good Southern girl would, I have a deep love in my heart for peaches. Deep, deep love. That fruity sweetness...is there anything better? There are few things in this life better than a fresh, juicy peach. A close second is ice cold peach tea. Peach cobbler, peach pie...summer is a good time to be in the South!<br /><br />I opened my package of this matcha and, my wife will back me up on this, my first words were ""Whoa, momma!"" It smells so good. Like juicy peach candy....nom. It smells painfully delicious.<br /><br />The taste certainly follows up on that scent! It tastes like a big, juicy peach lollipop. It's not a fresh peach, but it's a peach candy. It reminds me of the peach soda I used to get in high school at the local Food Lion to take to our weekly slumber party with my best friend. So I'm grateful for those memories. Makes me want to pop a big bag of popcorn and dip it in nacho cheese. Oh yes, we were super healthy.<br /><br />Anyway, this matcha has the same bitter kick as the lemon matcha, but a touch of sugar chased that away. I think that's just a matcha thing. It's definitely one I want to try again and see how it goes. Maybe cut it with a touch of the vanilla...peaches and cream! Yes please! This would be good in my smoothies this summer, maybe a peach raspberry smoothie dream...nom.<br /><br />I made a second cup with different parameters (12 ounces of water instead of 8 to one half teaspoon of matcha, as well as a bit more sugar) and it is heavenly. Juicy enough to satisfy this Southern gal! Finishing off my sample of this will be no great hardship, I assure you. It tastes like a fuzzy navel without the alcoholic bite! Or those peach gummy candies...yum!<br /><br />I let some of this chill and GAH. Cold, this is beyond amazing. This is what I needed, cold and fruity and peachy! It's not too sweet, it's not too bitter, it's just a beautifully refreshing cold drink for summer...I have a feeling this will be a staple in my cupboard this summer."	0	0
1	B005VOONLW	A2YUDGH7S6OXVO	good light coffee flavor	If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.  The bags are round, which makes it steep better than square bags.  There is no string on the bags to leach coffee from the cup onto the surface where you are steeping it.<br /><br />I shared this with friends.  Upon opening the packaging for the bag, every single one commented on the wonderful smell.  All those who liked a mild coffee described the flavor as SMOOOOOOTH.	0	0
1	B0010PM49E	A1IOGEZUZPII8C	Basket Delight	I bought this statehood gift basket to break apart the items into smaller gifts for friends/family.  It's over priced so I will not buy this again.  The contents are mainly food made in China,  like graham crackers and taffy etc. One of the reasons I wanted it was for the beautiful XL ceramic coffee mug in this set.  Basket/item  is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping/cardboard for bulk, so there is not that much in there.  It's fun to open and it will bring back memories of a state you resided in.  Overall I was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for China made items and some items listed in the product were NOT included in this particular gift.  ( items vary per set )	0	0
1	B001E5DZTS	A3SFPP61PJY61S	Not so goaty- which is Good!	Wonderful product! I began to use it for my daughter who was about to turn a year old. She took it with no problems! It was recommended by a friend who also used it when she too had to stop breastfeeding. Much better for a child in my eyes. I had tried a formula sample I had received in the mail- it left a greasy film in the bottle... gross. This does not! My daughter will drink it warm or cold- so easy for on the go as well. The canned was a bit harsh and she wasn't into it.. it tastes like a goat smells- this just has a suttle hint of goat. LoL	0	0
1	B001P05K8Q	A3ERFG42O010TR	Our dogs LOVE these!	We have two 4 year old Great Danes, and our vet recommended these for their teeth - and they LOVE them! It's hard to find treats for them that are big enough for them to enjoy (rather than just eating them in one bite!), and these keep them chewing for a while.  We've been giving these to them for nearly their whole life, and their teeth are in excellent condition! Plus, I feel good about giving them a treat that actually benefits them in some way.	0	0
-1	B0015V7E48	ABHPYOYYIX1JW	NASTY tasting	I just got these in the mail, and ripped into them anxious to try some licorice.  I finally decided on these after the reviews I read.  The texture is nice and chewy.... not to soft.  The Taste is nasty though.  Almost bitter.  It is like licorice, but there is this very overpowering bitter wierd taste.  It stays in your mouth and you have to eat something else to make the taste go away.  I even tried several pieces hoping it was something that would get better.... it did not!  I gave some to my children, who said no more thank you after the first bear.  One spit it in the trash.  Dissapointed since I now have 6+ pounds of this mess.  Wish they had a smaller option to try first.  I would recommend the regular fruit flavored sugar free bears.  they taste just like the full sugar bears.	0	0
1	B000084E6V	A2KAMN8AJOZKHI	Best dog toy on the market!	These dental dinosaurs are the best dog toy that I've found.

She continues to chew the toy until all you can see is a small unidentifiable circle for a few years.  Both of my dogs prefer the T-Rex the best.  Second choice of theirs is the Stegosaurus.  I wholeheartedly recommend this toy for any aggressive chewer.	2	0

-1	B006Q7YG24	A134C9GVEU5TQE	Some Do; Some Don't	I have about 20 cats so gave this product a true test. Results: some like it very much; some didn't...so it probably depends upon when you give your cats this product...<br /><br />Striper was my first taste tester...she went after it right away...but left it shortly thereafter...In fact, most of the cats and kittens did... it was too big for them! When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it... Probably depends upon their regular diets, but this wasn't a treat in my opinion...	1	0

1	B0002L3BYE	A2YZA9P0YQLOO	It's not the real thing -- of course! -- but extremely good for what it is	"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. And cream cheese-ey fruit dips, or marshmallow ""fluff"" spread, cannot possibly be duplicated without calories.  That is a fact of life.<br /><br />This marshmallow dip should not be compared to either of those foods, both of which are high in calories, sugar, and taste.  This dip should be compared to all the other low-calorie sweets out there that don't have potential to derail a diet.  And in that field, this dip definitely stands out, both in its taste and in the fact that it packs NO nutritional punch.  For me, it's good for a sweet tooth kick during the dog days of a diet.  It leaves a major aspartame after-taste, so if that's something you really hate, then don't get this.  I personally don't mind.<br /><br />I think the seriousness of your diet -- and your sensitivity/repulsion to after-tastes from artificial sweeteners -- will determine whether this is a winner for you or not.  It is obviously a big jar of chemicals.  (Though I'm sure there are plenty of chemicals in other marshmallow dips, too.)  For that reason, I wouldn't make this a daily part of my diet any more than I would any other purely artificial food.  But it sure is great, again, for the dog days of a diet.<br /><br />I got my jar at Kroger, here in Tennessee.  There were several Walden Farms items in the diet/health food area there."	0	0

That being said, if you like choc glazed donuts, you'll definitely like this k cup.  I've tried many different flavors and this one is truest to its name. It tastes just like a choc donut.  Other than saying ""it tastes just like a choc donut"", there isn't much more to say about the flavor. It's just good!  It is not my favorite, but it is definitely in my rotation.  My 9 year old convinced me to buy them (imagine that!).  I'm glad I did, and will definitely buy more.  I put a little big of sugar and a little bit of regular Coffee Mate creamer and its just perfect!  No after taste, and I made it on the largest setting.

1	B0029O0EFG	ACLUXWYUXMZXA	Not the best, but better than most	"I have two boys...well first we had one.

That's when we came across Octavious or ""silky"" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat.

It's a bit more coarse, and has a bit of a curl to it, but after using this shampoo for a short time I've found that my hair has more shine and is easier to style than with my previous shampoo which I paid more for.<br /><br />I do color my hair, but I can't really comment on how well it protects against fading since my color was a bit faded prior to using this shampoo, but if the product lives up to this claim like it does the others than I am sure it will do an admiral job.<br /><br />For the price I LOVE this shampoo.  I love the way it smells (not to fruity or flowery, just a nice scent) I love that my scalp is less irritated, and I like my hair more while using it (something that is hard to do).  My only wish was that it was sulfate free, but at this price I think I will be switching to this shampoo from now on!	0	0

I will be one of your faithful customers forever if you start making these in the US.<br /><br />I choose not to buy any products (especially food) made in China, because of 2 concerns: 1.  Human rights issues and the use of prisoners as unpaid laborers (this is why the price is cheap on Chinese-made goods) and 2.  Concerns for quality control.	4	2
1	B0016814QO	A2BSKJ2KZDZNR6	Quality cat treats; great price	My cats go insane over these treats. As soon as they hear the bag rattle, they dart to wherever it is. Purchasing through [...]  was easy, cost-efficient and the shipping was fast.	0	0

-1	B003PFUNU4	A2K2PP9ZSXZNSV	different tastes	In the past I have bought my syrup from World Market when on sale and when I lived in Seattle. Although  our local  Fred Meyer store stocks Torani the flavors are limited. So I  subscribed the the sugar free variety pack thinking I could tolerate the two flavors I don't much care for. Wrong. the Raspberry and Irish Creme keep piling up because I don't like them. But some reviewers have given me a few ideas. I merely tolerate the hazelnut and vanilla. Love the caramel and chocolate. What I would really like is to be able to select my own sugar free variety pack and or be able to purchase one that has coconut (my absolute fav), white chocolate, almond, caramel, peppermint, and gingerbread syrup (I am addicted to this flavor). I would even settle for sugar free coconut in the three pack. PLEASE add more flavors.	4	0
-1	B000EDG430	A3VRNEH9397AIS	Blah bread that sticks to the pan	I've been buying Bob's Red Mill bread mixes for about a year now. I like the 10 Grain Bread and, even more, the Potato Bread. I was disappointed by the Wonderful Bread. It requires more added ingredients, esp. eggs and egg whites. As a result, I was expecting something with more flavor. But the bread just tastes like regular white bread. It is softer than the 10 Grain - again, similar to packaged white bread. I use a bread machine. I've never had a problem with any other bread mix. But the Wonderful bread sticks to the sides of the pan. As a result, the finished loaf is always broken with large tears and holes on all sides. I suppose I could get past this if the bread was indeed Wonderful. But it isn't. It's just blah.	0	0
-1	B002TSA91Q	A15P429IXO6US9	NOT Unscented!	"This product says ""unscented"" all over it, but has a STRONG perfume smell - fragrance is listed as an ingredient.

1	B000UVKZXQ	A27GPCYLYYPXWE	Get The Auto Delivery And save	"The first time i had these I got them at ""Jacks"" In NYC for .99c a pack. I loved them. Have been dreaming of them. I got the bright idea to look for them on Amazon. Glad I did. Payed slightly more with the auto ship but worth every penny since I live in PA and the gas to get to the city is more then the case price. I like to toast them in the toaster oven for a few minutes. The flavor is very good. Very few off flavored nuts. I have had better luck with these then with the fresh."	1	0
1	B002V0LDX0	AJ3HLYX7FC73X	Excellent Choice	I use Paradise fruit cake mix over a while, always having excellent results. I bake around 100 fruitcakes as a small business I have during christmas, for the past 15 years. My costumers  always agree on that the quality and the selected fruits I use are remarkable. I had a hard time finding these over the counters in the supermarkets, and finally I found it in Amazon.	1	0
-1	B0002DHNXC	A38I2P244NDB5R	Not quite what I ordered...	I always buy the chicken flavor that walmart sells for around $6, so when I saw this BREATH one for about the same price, I was very happy (both of our large dogs love to get up close and personal!). However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!<br /><br />However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!	1	0
-1	B006Q820X0	#oc-R2JCC3EI274MDF	Something wrong with K cups	"The first 4 kcups of this coffee would only fill cup about 1/4 full. Upon opening lid the coffee was oozing out of top of K Cups and made a real mess. cleaned machine and tried it again and same thing happened.  Then tried other brand k cups and they worked perfectly as usuall!!!  Dont know if I just got a ""bad batch"" but all other brands work fine. I will try a couple more times and then will probably dump them...gave a couple to my friends to see what happens in their machine....still luv my CUISINART KERUIG though!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  The company sent me a replacement box for the above mentioned ones.....Decaf...The first one worked ok and the coffee was OK...but THEN THE SAME THINGS HAPPENED AS IN PREVIOUS POST. Have tried 5 of them they all were defective...and other brands worked just fine...So wont be wanting anymore of them. customer service was very nice but they just need to fix the cups."	4	6
-1	B004FGWU9O	AMEEXXHSFDS3Z	Yuk!  Twangy aftertaste and weak coffee make this one to avoid.	I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldn't tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one, this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial.  Yeah, I know it's artificial but I hate that it actually tastes like a chemical!  Yuk...<br /><br />This is one of those coffees you can serve to company who doesn't know good coffee or people you don't want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they won't be your friends after it!  It really is quite bad.	1	4
-1	B004XAPIOQ	AXOL6YBUN2DAW	For the price...	"...I would go with something else.  Check the price, this Kellogg's cereal is over $4 a 12-oz box, even at the current Amazon sale price if you have to pay shipping.<br /> I picked up a box at Kroger this week and it was over $4.  Don't necessarily like to see the BHT but I'm not alarmist about it.  As long as we eat GF, my kids and I are certainly healthy enough for a little detox.  My problem: there is nothing about this cereal to justify the high price!  The flavor is just flat - they didn't even substitute the signature malt flavoring with some rice malt syrup.  This has got to be made nearly as cheaply as regular rice krispies - I feel like many companies slap on a ""gluten free"" label and think that justifies a hefty price.  (Kudos to the Chex brand for NOT doing this.)  I don't buy many convenience foods and I don't allow my kids to eat cereal very often so I will probably only buy these on special occasions when we want Rice Krispies Treats - the real deal, because I haven't found a single ""health food"" version of crispy rice cereal that has that same crispy (not crunchy,) airy, slightly flattened shape and texture that really make a good crispy treat."	2	2
1	B002PNAB04	ASTVIEPELWRXH	Almost Perfect	These chocolate treats are wonderful. My husband really enjoyed these over Valetine's Day. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because 3 of the 4 liquors are orange flavored. Still delicious, but I really would like more variety. How about Amaretto, or Rum?	0	0
1	B00474G3BU	A1EMFVSGQIBSC2	Remarkable, Best Seasoning for Everything!	I was recently in Mexico where I sampled this for the first time.  Not quite sure why I'd never tried it before as I go there every year...but, WOW, this was an eye opener.  It's all the best flavors of the Yucatan in a bottle!  Lime, chili (but not too much) and salt, with a few others thrown in for good measure.  It's tangy, zippy, salty and wicked good on almost anything.  We roasted chicken with it, put it on the guacamole, stirred it into black beans and even used it to rim Margarita glasses.  I'd call it the best seasoning ever.	6	0

1	B0041NYV8E	A1PQ76H0AFQ0CR	a nice balance between the two flavors	The trick with a product like this is that there are two ingredients that can overwhelm each other: ginger and lemon.<br /><br />The powered substance here nicely balances the two flavor, so that you are not overwhelmed with either.<br /><br />As a hot beverage and alternative to tea, it is fine for occasional use.	0	0
-1	B00503DP0O	A3RMDNEHSF11TQ	Interesting...	It has an interesting texture that most people might find to be off-putting. Plus, as far as bars go, it is not all that filling. It also leaves your mouth feeling sort of chalky and full of oat kernels.	0	0
-1	B000KENKXA	A38583MMBXVQPW	Bland, dry	"There wasn't anything I liked about this cornbread.  It had a bitter taste and very little flavor. It was also very dry. The directions seemed a little fussy.

1	B000EHP62Q	A2FSYC2JWCGLN	Excellent source of fiber that tastes good!	This is the best high-fiber cereal I've tasted.  It was refreshing to eat a breakfast cereal that doesn't taste like cardboard.  Smells delicious too.  It doesn't need milk on it, so if you don't like milk, you don't need to add it. For those following Weight Watcher's--it's 1 pt per packet.	4	0
1	B0007OPVZ8	A305DF6TYKD5FL	Where is the wild cherry?	I have loved these sour balls since childhood but was really disappointed that each can had only 1--I repeat-1 wild cherry sourball. The red included in numbers is something like a raspberry. Really poor form, Charms folks.	3	0

-1	B001E5E2RC	A18AUBLB3TQH56	Disappointing	I use a lot of sugar-free vanilla syrup and thought I'd try the Torani. I was very disappointed--I had to add vanilla extract to it to get much flavor.	0	0
-1	B008K9TJDM	A2ZZBMQPEEC3QS	Great coffee, get a better price.	This is my favorite coffee.  I had to go off caffeine, so I love that this has a nice strong coffee flavor.

1	B0007SN7B4	A61BZ5FOFWSW9	The Best Stuff Around	There is a reason this pepper sauce has garnered nothing but 5-star ratings. It can't be beat. We first encountered this product at the Wagon Wheel in Carmel Valley. It is terrific on eggs and fried potatoes. Fortunately, they were also selling it, so we purchased a bottle to try at home and we have never stopped buying it.<br /><br />Living in Southern Cal, we have not found a source in this area, but it is plentiful in the Central Coast and Northern Cal areas. We buy it by the case directly from the producer at a great price.<br /><br />We recommend sticking with the Original California Style. Have tried the other variations, but the Original is the best. It has plenty of zip, but does not overwhelm your taste buds with heat. The focus is on flavor.	2	0
-1	B002I7TKJ0	AFZUQHVCHUOCG	Beware - Kellogg's has reformulated this	"At the suggestion of my doctor, I have been eating Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus cereal for breakfast every day for several years now. A few days ago I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states ""satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says ""Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber"".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.  Shame on you. Fool me twice.  Shame on me.  I will not be eating Kellogg's products anymore."	1	0

-1	B000CSRBXY	AQ6AGWKWMTY8H	Yuck.  Love Orville BUT Really Hate This Product	"I eat a considerable amount of popcorn every week and it's almost always Redenbacher.  I like the brand.  BUT this product is dreadful.  First, it's salty. Waaay too salty. Secondly, it's pretty greasy.  Not buttery mind you, but greasy.<br /><br />And it gets worse.  On top of those drawbacks is the fact that it smells awful.  It has a sort of chemically odor and what's really odd... it does not smell like popcorn.  You know how microwaving popcorn will make people come creeping out of the woodwork looking for a handful of fluffy corny goodness!  Not with this product.  Heck, my kids won't eat it.  And after experimenting to see if the second bag was as bad as the first, I threw out the rest of the box.<br /><br />THE SKINNY:::<br />I've reviewed over a thousand products and given less than a handful 1-Star. I'm adding Orvilles ""Natural"" popcorn to that elite list because its just gross.  I despise it and fear to feed it to my children because of the unattractive smell.<br /><br />Stick with Orville's Butter or Lite-Butter or Tender White or one of the flavored types.  They taste good and the smell good.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />upset mom/blogger"	3	3

-1	B005SB03FS	A3KVJQZM7GNBEK	These taste good.	It's 25 calories for four pieces of hard candy, which is decent, especially if you're feeling snackish and are on a strict calorie budget. Other than that, I didn't think it was a good deal. The package is small and lasted me around a week. I prefer YummyEarth lollipops--you definitely get more for your buck, and they taste better, too.	0	0
-1	B008ZRKZSM	A1L331YOJ0OL4Q	Great flavor!	This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.	180	8

V_L saved our dinner problems many times--like when we got into the park after dark and needed to eat and get the tents up.  We ate them cold mixed with vegetarian beans (no pork).  They are a great quickie meal when we are doing a 70 hour work week, great on a bun with sourkraut, or toppings and pickles, or just the kiddie standard of ketchup.  Grilled in the summer is good too for a different taste.  We buy by the case, they don't last long around here.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Diane Kalata	1	0

The taste is nothing special, a little too chewy and dry, but for me the huge down-side was an awful skin reaction; hive-like itchy outbreak within 30-45 minutes of eating these.  I do have some food allergies, but saw nothing on the label that concerned me.  I will be working with my allergist to try to determine the problem.

-1	B0029ZAOW8	AKS623GKL5ZMX	Works Physically, but not Mentally	After 6 or 7PM, I tend to be pretty worn out. I saw one of these in my brother's car, and he didn't want it, so I decided to go for it. I drank the whole bottle, and I felt the effects after about 30 min. I didn't have any weird side effects, but I noticed myself twitching a lot. It does some things correctly, as physically I feel decent, but mentally I feel awful. It's the kind of feeling you get when you want to go to sleep, but you can't. The best word to describe it is restless. It also tastes awful, but you can't really mark it down based on taste, as it's not obviously supposed to be something that tastes good.<br /><br />I'll give it a couple of stars for making me feel a little better physically, but that's still questionable, as it also made me very twitchy. Definitely not a product I'd recommend to anyone, unless they felt physically fatigued. A lot of people here seem satisfied with it, so maybe it's just me.	0	2
1	B004GW6O9E	A1LN1IPB98N37J	Clean and Delicious	No added anything.<br /><br />I eat one of these every morning on my way out the door.  Great complement to some granola and yogurt when fresh fruit is out of the question.  Keeps you satisfied.<br /><br />I love em.  Simple raw ingredients produce a fantastic diversity of nutrition.<br /><br />You won't find natural nutritional balance like this in anything else.<br /><br />To the negative reviewers here: these are not candy bars.  There is no added sugar so they are somewhat tart.  They provide nearly a full meal's worth of balanced nutrition.  Yes, that means fruit/vegetable proteins, fats, and sugars.	2	0

I have given these treats to an array of doggies: english bulldogs, a boston terrier, a hound mix, and several mutt breeds...the overall consensus? Two very enthusiastic paws up! Not one of the dogs turned it down. Pretty impressive. No matter how fussy your dog, or how limited his or her dietary restrictions, these treats not only drive them wild, but have added goodies to improve their health. Ya' can't go wrong! I also would try the other varieties (heart health, breathies, vitality) each has a lil' something to address your dog's specific needs, and above all, they will love 'em.	2	2

I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, ""Chocolate Cream Oreo"".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: ""Chocolate Cream Oreo"".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say ""Double Stuf"" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf."	3	1

1	B004UEG1XM	A5WHOQ7PPXDBE	Best ever for hashbrowns at home	These appear to be the same product which used to be sold at Costco under the Golden Grill brand in same size packaging and they could not keep the pallets full. The Golden Grill suddenly disappeared from Costco and Hungry Jack appeared at the local grocery chains.  Both are made by Basic American Foods.  History aside, these are as good as any hashbrowns anywhere.  Being single and retired I divide the carton into six small rubbermaid containers and prepare as needed.  I like to put a small amount of frozen chopped onions on top while pan-grilling and then flip over after 4 minutes for a minute or so to complete the process. The lowest price I have found thus far is at Walmart for $1.25 per package and their shelf is sometimes empty. I would give 6 stars if available.  Note: They also make a cheesy hashbrown variety which i do not care for at all.	0	0
-1	B005F1X268	A2W3HMU1ZPT15U	Picture doesn't match description	I didn't actually order this but was sent it by mistake. In searching to see what might have happened, I found it and noticed that the picture doesn't match the description--and I can tell you from what I was sent, it is the description that is correct, not the picture. That is to say, this includes Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade. If when you read this review you see that the picture shows Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade, you can ignore this review--I'm just putting it here to warn people not to be deceived by the picture (I plan to take this review down if the picture is changed to properly reflect what's in the box but there will inevitably be at least a delay in me doing that and perhaps I'll even just forget to do it entirely).	0	0
-1	B003QNLUTI	A2CJL1UC67IYR0	they really do work	They do work, and don't taste too bad<br /><br />Only complaint and reason I didn't give 5 stars is they are expensive little buggers; wish these things would come down in price.	0	0
-1	B000FNEX8C	A2C10VHHV4HYZU	So disappointing!	This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity. Ah well... lesson learned.	3	3
-1	B0018CG2MO	A2HNASPU7NVTD8	I have 4 cats...	and two of them won't eat it. Generally they are not finicky. Even one of the two feral cats that I feed passed on it.<br />Perhaps it is the best cat food on the planet, but if they leave it in the dish, there must be something missing.	1	0
1	B002RU3GH0	A1W3HXE7NFEI4Y	Good Stuff!	I factually ordered this in to mix with neem oil for my son's acne. Didn't realize it was also edible. lol!  Works great with the neem to take out the stink.  I've been looking for natural handlings for his acne and these are working for him.<br /><br />Anyhow, I used it to whip up some scrambled eggs; delicious! I will use this for other cooking!!!<br /><br />I also somehow acquired a spider bite on my forehead and I heard coconut oil is good for that so I put a little on that and voila, the pain was gone and it shrunk down and disappeared faster than I have ever had a spider bite disappear.  Tried it on a mosquito bite too.  Took the itch away (I get quite the reaction from mosquito bites) and the swelling disappeared, as did the mosquito bite by the next day.<br /><br />Quite happy with the product.<br /><br />Seriously, if you are looking for cocnut oil to cook with, this is it.  Tastes great and is, apparently from what I have read and heard, much better than using animal product or plant based (canola, soybean) oil (GMO).	0	0
-1	B0034EDMLI	A1EAOYP31O6JLY	False ingredients	This should be named the macadamia/coconut/apricot bar.  The second ingredient on the box contents is coconut, which I detest.  This list of ingrdients is false.  I was very suprised.  I would not have thought Kind would go this.	2	8
-1	B005ZBZM52	AN0F1HW0S6XWB	Yuk!!	I'll say it again....YUK!!! It is horrible tasting. Doesn't even taste like coffee. Has a bitter after taste too.<br /><br />That is 20 words!! Come on!!	0	5
1	B000G1X456	A36HK6V63C02XE	Great for Strong Coffee lovers--Simply the best coffee!!!	If you like strong coffee, this is it!  The flavor is exceptional, I have not found better in a can.  This can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store.  I have had great luck with Amazon, good price for the subscription order (you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate).  Amazon also has a wonderful return policy!<br />Try Yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you, this may be it!  We have been drinking it for 10+ years now & have had the Original, Organic and Dark Roast---I dont have a preference, they are all excellent.	3	0
1	B003G91OZM	A1LX8K5L3CGC1A	Umm umm good!	This is our favorite popcornopolis flavor, but its a shame they don't seem as fresh as they should.  In fact they were kind of stale, but they were still good!	0	0
-1	B0032CJYF0	A2XQCFBPJ6TR81	Bad!	These taste so bad - almost rancid! I had purchased a similar bag at a grocery store (same brand- plain banana chips) so I was surprised at how bad these were. Perhaps it's the Acai berry in them??	0	0
1	B0045G8KHA	A3K8DFO3TXWNG0	Cherry Yummmmm	There's no mistaking there's a lot of maraschino cherry flavor, even in the liquid.  But that is fantastic.  Why are people always so stingy with the cherries! The fruit was very fresh and firm, not mushy.  I think the value on these little cups is great.  And the fact that it has the mixed fruit makes it pleasing to both kiddos. Winner.	1	0
1	B001VNGG58	A2AC4MOO4UVWWJ	SCAT Squirrels !!!	I put Cayenne pepper on bird seed to keep squirrels away from the feeders.  (Use a mask and gloves to sprinkle the Cayenne over the seeds and mix well; add to feeder.)  The birds have different  glands than  mammals (squirrels are mammals!).  The birds are NOT affected by the hot at all; they don't taste it.  Main problem is that when it rains some of the cayenne is washed off and then you'll see a squirrel occasionally until you refill the feeder .... but this has sure saved on my sunflower seed expenditures!!  I only use about a tablespoon or so to a feeder-full of seed.	3	0
1	B0032JKWGI	ALQ3QLLP30HLG	Cheaper than other brands	Tastes like drinking a cherry pie. I purchased this for my mother's gout and she told me it works quickly. It's also supposed to help lower blood pressure. Speedy delivery. It's not 5 stars because of the high price.	3	0
1	B001GQ3E2S	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Best Peanut Better Ever, Kids Will Love!	"*****<br />This is a peanut butter you can feel truly good about eating AND about giving to your children. Look up ""palm fruit oil"" on the Internet...google it...it is extremely healthy...the base of this peanut butter. Note that there IS added sugar, but it is relatively little.<br /><br />I normally eat unsweetened peanut butter as well as other nut butters and find this lightly sweetened peanut butter a fantastic treat. Put a little of this on a whole grain cracker and you'll be in heaven! In my case, it satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't want more--say a rich dessert--and so I am thrilled to tolerate the slight amount of sugar for the huge amount of benefit.<br /><br />No matter if you are a commercial peanut butter consumer or a purist who loves unsweetened raw nut butters--you will find much to love here--ESPECIALLY after you research all of the benefits of palm fruit oil. My husband is a junk food and fast food man and he also loves this...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"	7	0

I've stopped using Crisco and started using Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in place of it.  I haven't found a recipe yet where it didn't work.  It does lend a coconut flavor to everything, so if coconut's not your thing, this may not be a great product for you.	0	0
-1	B007RTR89S	A1509YCCYCYQQ3	Still an issue with continer	Let me share the positive first.<br />This is a fine shampoo. I can't say I saw anything very special about it's shampooing ability, all the promised scalp and hair benefit, but I saw no negatives either. Just does a nice job<br />I think it has a pleasant smell, not too strong in my opinion.<br />And it has a nice consistency, although the lavender color is a little strange and unnecessary.<br /><br />But back to that container.<br />In use it is nice, wide, easy to use tilt top.<br />But once again (I reviewed a different variety of this brand before) the bottle leaked in transit.<br />Certainly a problem if you plan to buy it online. This time the top was wrapped in plastic, but it still came partially open and leaked. I guess the same factors that make it easy to use in a wet shower make it too easy to open in an Amazon box in shipping.	0	0
-1	B002T0IHPO	AIWOLCUA8T2KC	Energy drink taste, little of the effect.	"The taste is spot on but after drinking it I felt little to no effect, but I guess that's what you'll get from a ""healthy"" energy drink with barely any caffeine."	2	2
1	B0014X8WIE	A3M4D3YRNSZXPO	Nesquik vanilla powder	Hard to find this vanilla flavor.... wish I could find it in regular grocery stores again. I LOVE it in coffee instead of sugar, less calories and good tasting. Now if it could just get a bit cheaper. A local Mexican grocery store sometimes carries this which is cheaper than sending for it via internet.... but I'm glad they have this for my backup. I think the flavor is a 5 star but the cost dropped it to a 4 star.	1	0
-1	B0007IJE0W	A300KTZ2YAYAZ	Not so hot package	I sorry to say the the majority of the package consisted of fancy boxes with not much in them, and some had stale products unworthy of a mother's day gift. The only decent things were some chocolate flavored candies and coffee. I'm very disappointed in this product, and do not recommend that you waste your money on it.	2	0
-1	B0006VB3S6	A1I560DYPRC9QV	not so everlasting	my german shepherd went thru this in less than 20 mins. I was very disappointed.

So, although I personally didn't taste this, my german shepherd plowed thru in record time.	0	0

-1	B000KOWJQE	AM18CU72YEWH5	The formula has changed!	"I used to like the bulk Equal sweetener for flavoring things like plain yogurt with rather sour fresh berries mixed into it, instead of opening multiple little packets.  Alas, in a move to ""measure like sugar,"" the manufacturers have bulked it out significantly more with, apparently, cornstarch.  Worse, you can actually TASTE the bulking agent, and it tastes obtrusive and peculiar.  I will no longer be buying this product."	1	0
1	B005VOONLW	AJ329F9H546BM	Nice mellow flavor..........................	With all the coffees around it is refreshing to have an Etheopian grind that tastes this good.

No acidity or bitterness yet distinctive Ethiopian beans and flavor.	0	2

-1	B001ULOTKU	A2UVRQI23RKNN2	Not Good on several levels	Made in China! Food quality and growing conditions concern me.  Packages are full of small broken pieces. Couldn't tell how many of each fruit were in the 12 count variety box. Thought there'd be 4 of each flavor...Only 2 pears and 2 strawberries - rest were apples.  Taste is very good but never would have bought if I'd known the origin. Not sure where packaging failed but broken tiny pieces aren't what my 1-year old grandson wants. USA doesn't have fruit???  Won't buy again.	10	4
1	B003V3AX0K	A3VE9ONTVM7UTV	Easiest healthy meal to cook!	"In the past few years, I started ""growing"" in the stomach region... so I decided to start eating better<br /><br />I'm not much of a cook so I tried those already-made Tofu Burgers that they sell in the stores that you just heat up, but unfortunately, they did not suit my palate.<br />Plus, I don't really know what they use for flavoring and what not...<br /><br />This TOFU BURGER MIX on the other hand, I can tailor the flavor however I want.<br />After a little research, I found out that FIRM or EXTRA FIRM TOFU works better.<br /><br />Grab that plastic tub of tofu and stick your hand on top and flip it upside down, over the sink and start pushing any excess water out.<br />Then flip it back over and throw it in a bigger bowl to start mushing down.<br />Rip open a package of this stuff and pour it in with the tofu and start mushing it some more.<br /><br />Get some vegetable oil, make little balls of this tofu mixture and throw it on the frying pan.<br /><br />Personally, I found that SO-MEN TSUYU(sauce) works best for me. Very light flavor.<br />I actually throw in some zucchinis and fry it next to the tofu burger with the SO-MEN TSUYU.<br /><br />In my experience, one package is good for about 4-5 people.<br />I think it's a great way to start a healthy diet."	4	0

-1	B0000DGF5S	AEU0TVTYJRUU4	Falling leaves	"I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as ""highest"" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan"	5	0

I can eat as many as I like yet the amount has less calories than if I was eating chips.  I can only eat so many nuts at a time while I can pig out on chips and waste lots of calories.

I got these for my lunch breaks, and I literally dread eating these now. I feel like I have to as I don't want to waste them, but these are just bad. No taste, gravy is watered down, and the chicken is just atrocious.<br /><br />Save yourself some money and stay CLEAR of these. The price went up nearly $5 dollars since the time that I bought them, so as of right now the price is just ridiculous for a 6 pack. $17 is way too much!	0	0

This was just too much of a fake pumpkin flavor with subtle undertones of, oh, I dunno, some sort of a plastic taste.  I would have liked to have had some chocolate flavor in there to maybe tone it down a bit or something.  Thumbs down from this lover of all things confectionary, but still glad I tried them because I'm always in search of a winner.  Definitely don't take my word for it though.  Just try them.  You may love them."""	2	0
1	B008O3G25W	AR3ECVXFV9VRJ	Awesome treat!	What I really like about this treat is that it is something you hold while your dog licks it--rather than him taking his chewy someplace and getting busy with it, he ends up looking at me, holding my gaze for as long as I'll let him keep lickin' that rollerball. Awesome for my friend's dog who's old and can't chew. (This is the liver flavor--which smells awesome. The bacon did not ship, but my pup doesn't mind.)	2	0

HFCS is chemically altered and unnatural and therefore is an artificial flavor. I found this labeling misleading and untrue. I wish they would use real sugar instead of HFCS. I know it costs a little more, but I believe parents would be willing to pay the extra money especially when it comes to our kids health. I know I would...KRAFT, please change your packaging and consider making the switch to REAL sugar."	0	1

The cola flavor was a trifle wishy-washy, with a slightly sourish aftertaste. I think that the herbal sweetener, stevia, is the culprit there. The carbonation was adequate, which helped to offset the taste factor. Beverages sweetened with stevia may be an acquired taste; we've got 23 more chances to test that theory!"	2	1
1	B002RU3GH0	A1PTTPTZRWD6V5	Never made it out of the kitchen	I bought this coconut oil to help tame my bangs, which are somewhat fried due to my hot iron.  I thought I would try it in the kitchen - and it is so tasty it never made it to the bathroom.  It pours right out of the bottle (I live in Texas - A/C is expensive so my house may be warmer than most) and it has a light scent and slightly sweet delicious taste.  I use it stirfrying, panfrying, and in recipes.  I will have to buy another bottle soon, and next time I'll buy two because I still want to try it on my hair.	2	0
1	B005VOONLW	A3U5HKDHPYBAK3	rich and smooth coffee	Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.	0	0

-1	B000FPKX5C	A2843M2KUXFECX	A good choice for new crunchers and munchers!	I was pretty wild about these for awhile when my little guy started eating solid food; they dissolve easily and he has fun picking them up. If I put a bunch in his tray, he'll try to shovel them in, but if I put one at a time down he'll pick them up with a thumb and finger. He's fun to watch, learning new things.<br /><br />I do worry about the added sugar, so I've been holding back a little on these lately, offering them less often and giving him Cheerios instead. The Gerber/Nestle corn crunchies are a little up in the sodium, too. Kid snacks don't need that stuff, really, so I'm looking for alternatives, but I think these will still be around at our house for awhile; everything in moderation. :)	0	0
1	B004HOLD92	A1XFKWAR5STF0	Great flavor, smart packaging	These are excellent. The flavor is strong and pleasant.

Since I like to cook a lot at once and use the rest for left-overs, the other gluten free (brown rice and potato only brands) did not do well when re-heated, and also had a ""different"" consistency --according to my daughter.  This brand is incredible, perfect texture, cooks easily, and my husband (who is a Sicilian) will even eat it , and once mistook it for his favorite brand!  Bionature has achieved the perfect pasta for picky gluten-free eaters.  If you are celiac, or gluten-sensitive, you MUST try it."	15	0

Shortly after opening the bag we saw that treats were covered in white & blue mold. Unacceptable & disgusting. The bag's sticker has ""X00133D6P"" on it. I have bought Plato products many times previously and have been pleased, however, these are supposed to be safe and quality treats. I absolve the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet, of responsibility of this issue as they have taken swift steps to rectify the issue. However, I do firmly assert that Plato should have done a much better job of notifying customers of a bad batches of Sweet Potato treats."	3	1

I use it as a simmer sauce for my meatballs and stuffed peppers and it works out fine, just as if I would make it myself, which I usually did, before I've found this one. Really good.	3	0
1	B000NCXHFA	ATMTE0BSP7W6S	Mung Beans for sprouting	I wanted to feed my chickens, turkeys and goats just a little extra protein to keep them fit and healthy while the goats are pregnant over the winter and the chickens and turkeys are getting ready for breeding season.  Sprouts seemed like a good idea but everytime I tried to sprout regular beans they would go bad before the sprouts were big enough to interest the poultry.  So I saw that the ones I was eating out of can were grown from mung beans.  Never heard of them before but thought I'd give it a try.  The beans took longer to get here than I would have liked (almost two weeks) but that just tells me the time frame I need before I order more.  And the beans!!!!  Oh my goodness, you'll get 100% germination and sprouts that are easily eaten and really quite yummy in just three days.  I need to get a bigger growing apparatus so that I can make more at one time.  The chickens, turkeys, goats and even my pregnant cow LOVE the sprouts.  I've found the extra source of protein I needed.  Thanks so much.	0	0
-1	B000OQXXOA	A3QDGKE0NAS0WO	eh...	"Intersting tea. I wasnt sure what they meant by ""pearls"" but when I received the tea, and put it in the water, the leaves are shaped like little pearls and they fill out and turn into whole leaves in the water. Kinda cool, I like that. This is NOT like Hedleys Jasmin green tea, no Jasmin green tea is. I dont know what it is about that brand, but they are out of business now, it was the most exceptional green tea Ive ever tasted, its like sipping jasmin perfume.<br /><br />However this tea, comes in second, I guess.<br /><br />But its not worth how expesive it is, not worth the money"	0	0
1	B005JRGJ4A	A3CXDSSYBFU37H	This works perfectly for us!	We love this formula!! We started supplementing with the Gerber Gentle, but our daughter had a bit of an allergy and reflux so we went with the Gerber Soy until she was 5 months. While transitioning back to the Gerber Gentle, we found that the  thinness of the powder formula really aggravated her reflux. This ready to feed works so much better for our family! The new packaging means less weight to carry in her diaper bag. I would give it 5 stars if the carton was resealable since she's only drinking about 5 of the 8.45 ounces.	1	0
1	B001S38AK0	A29ES5PXIOSU9H	the un-wimpy chocolate	If you're not used to dark chocolate, Ghirardelli 72% takes a while to get used to because it's flavor is stronger than most others in the 70-72% range. I used to like Lindt 70% (before they changed the recipe), but Ghirardelli's flavor is more unadulterated and stronger, with a bitterness and 'bite' that I like. A lot of other chocs (especially the more common supermarket brands) strive for smoothness and creaminess...in other words yuck. This one doesn't. 72% is a very nice cocoa percentage. This is my staple chocolate in the 70-72% range. I have tasted even better chocs in this cocoa range, but they are organic ones from the health food store that cost at least 1/3rd more.	2	0
-1	B001E6EE4C	A38D3EWPD85JAH	Sucralose in cereal?!	One might think that the sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn syrup in this cereal would be enough.

-1	B003V8SQM2	A25ETQX6Z2U3T7	Good but too much salt	This is the perfect snack for people who need gluten free on the run snacks, however, the sodium is 330 per serving, making it too high in salt for me.  The sad part is they dont need that much salt, the product woluld be great with half that amount.  I ended up feeding mine to the squirrels.	1	2

I had hoped to use them as small training treats (such as the BilJac liver treats), but she would have nothing to do with either the peanut butter or the salmon flavor. The salmon variety has a very strong ""fishy"" smell, too."	1	2
1	B0030VJ97Q	A2IRI9FQ3Y2THO	Great texture and tastes delicious	The Happy Baby Chick Chick is delicious and my baby loves it.  It's a hearty puree, not so runny.

-1	B008I1XPKA	#oc-R317IV2026UMOV	If you like strong and flavorfull coffee, don't buy Brooklyn Beans	Don't believe the hype about this coffee being strong and flavorfull. I was looking for new options besides Jetfuel, Emeril's Big and Bold, and Donut House, and thought BB would be the one, based on the reviews. I'm not sure what coffee they got, but the Fuggedaboutit and Cyclone are both really weak and without much flavor. I even tried the smallest size setting, thinking it might make the coffee more concentrated, but it was still weak and dissapointing. I can't speak for the other coffee, but Fuggedaboudit and Cyclone were a waste of my money. I have a machine at home and at work, so I will just take them to work as an option for people who like weaker coffees.	7	2
1	B000I1OLT2	AUDH0P4ZHJKS2	Balanced and refreshing	I first discovered this tea at my local coffeeshop, and I became enough of an addict that I had to order a 6-pack from Amazon.

-1	B004YV80OE	AERBY54RWPSO9	Where's the broccoli?  Kids hated it.	"I LOVE Velveta but stopped eating 9 years ago when we switched to a healthy diet.  My kids, especially one of them in particular, loves mac n cheese, and that same mac n cheese addict also loves broccoli, so I thought this was a no brainer.  My husband and I liked the flavor, but the kids hated it.  I was expecting basically Velveta shells and cheese with broccoli and chicken and instead was flavored with chicken broth and less a mac n cheese than something else I guess.  This is most likely why the kids did not like it.  The ""pasta"" was small little rice sized/shaped pasta, forget what it is called, but I prefer larger pasta than that.  The broccoli was non-existent, it was a tiny packet of freeze dried broccoli ""florets"" that only added little green flecks to the meal, poorly done Kraft.  This product is high in sodium and calories and has many ingredients with hidden MSG in them (anything hydrolyzed or autolyzed and anythign that says ""protein extract"" or yeast extract) and it does not give anyone any vegetables.  Honestly a person is better off cooking from chicken and broccoli and adding it to Velveta shells and cheese."	3	2

1	B0054TWQMM	A26X7W5UM5QFT4	These are GREAT!	"I had visions of ""Chia Pets"" when ordering these, but based on reported nutritional value, we got some anyway.<br /><br />While there is little taste - particularly in smoothies for example, the texture does exactly what the product packaging says it will do - thicken up fairly rapidly.<br /><br />I don't know what else can be said about this product, other than it is a particularly great smoothie ingredient.  There are other possible uses, and they seem very reasonable now that we've actually used the chia seeds, we just happen to prefer to use it with smoothies.<br /><br />The one negative is the price - nearly $10.00 per pound seems a bit steep, even for organic seeds.  Still, a little goes a long way."	1	0
-1	B001E5DYM6	A1237BT5DI3GDX	Bleh...	"Can't tell if I'm really satisfied with these or not.  First, they're hard.  Almost like hard candy.  I tend to mix it with my cereal hoping that they'll soften from the milk but they don't always do.  I'm not sure if you can really benefit from these.  They're so dried that they seem ""lifeless"" as in the majority of goji benefits have been sucked out.  I won't be buying these again unless I see improvement from eating the rest of these hard goji berries."	3	0
-1	B0029JRYEU	AH7N222VSN99B	Bad Batch of Tomatoes	I have been using Tuttorosso Crusted Tomatoes for years, never had a problem wouldn't use any other brand. My family thinks I am crazy but the last couple of batches of gravy (yes I call it gravy not sauce) taste different to me. I even used the tomatoes in my Chicken Cacciatore and it tasted different to me.<br />I think there is a bad batch of tomatoes out there. Today I made gravy and when I was opening the cans of tomatoes I realized the cans expiring in November of 2012 taste better then the cans expiring in Febuary of 2012. Also the blue cans taste better then the green.  I will still buy the tomatoes(not the ones expiring in Feb 2012) but would like to know if anyone else has had this problem	2	1
1	B008C2JCUW	A3GPL5JEP3G1VS	Use before showering on dry/frizzy hair	I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have thick, wavy black hair (which has been dyed brown in the past), and I thought this was an okay product to use. Even though it's not perfect, I would say my hair is better when I use this product than when I don't use this product.If your hair is naturally oily and rarely gets dry, you're fortunate enough not to need oils like these. But if your hair gets dry and perhaps frizzy once you're out of the shower, you should try this hair oil.<br /><br />I use this product 2 or 3 times a week. I massage it into my hair at least half an hour before I take a shower. It smells a little, and it's really up to you whether you find it a good or bad smell, but I personally don't like it. When I'm in the shower, I use small amounts of shampoo and conditioner (which is what you're supposed to do anyway) and wash out my hair with cold water. Then I let my hair air-dry or towel-dry and apply a leave-in conditioner of a different brand. And my hair feels good afterward! It's not dry nor oily, it doesn't look frizzy, and people have told me my hair is looking healthier over time.<br /><br />I basically don't like the smell of this product. And I'm sure there are much better, albeit more expensive, hair oil brands out there. But if you need to cure your hair of dryness, you should make your shower routine more like mine.	0	0
1	B001E5E2R2	A1XE0O9OVY4RED	So real tasting like fresh Raspberries.	This brand of syrup has become my favorite after purchasing it about 3 years ago.  But the raspberry is the best.  It tastes like real raspberries and even without sugar is delicious.  I put this in coffee,  or to make a milk shake,  or over shaved Ice for the Summer.  It was delivered very well wrapped and fast.  This is the Best syrup.	3	0

1	B004HOLD4W	A1E8F0AYFXPCRB	Amazing	Better tasting then just about any potato chip and tons healthier too, especially for low carb diets. These things are just amazing.

By chance I looked on line and was pleased to find it.  After happily receiving it a couple months the next batch came in ""new and improved""!  Bummer!!! We loved the old and just right!  Almost cancelled but the new grew on us.  The flakes are harder than the old ones which we don't like and although it says less sugar it seems sweeter which it didn't need.  Prefer the former product but it is still one of our favorites and we will continue to buy it."	0	0
-1	B004E4EBMG	AHFGCH8LANEZK	Not for me	"I was excited to try this ""water enhancer"" with the mango peach flavor, as I love mango flavored anything (well almost).  I squirted this Mio Liquid into a glass of cold water and was hoping for the best.  It just tasted like a melted popsicle or similar.  I thought the squirts would be more measured, but they are not, so I don't know how you can know if you got enough flavoring or not.  I squirted a few more squirts into my glass, hoping that I didn't put enough in.  With more flavoring, it wasn't any better.<br /><br />I don't have any, but I wondered if using this stuff in sparkling water would work better.  This flavoring in regular drinking water just doesn't work for me.  I would rather drink plain water than this.  Another scenario that this may or may not work in is the water at Disney World.  The water there tastes like sulfur, and it is something awful.  Don't know if this would mask that taste or not."	1	1
-1	B0053O8OIS	A3CP9LMG5SM5KK	Really good!  Bag hard to use.	Product tastes fabulous!  I ordered these with a Fair Trade spicy hot cocoa, and this is by far better!  Even though it contains instant dry milk.  Wish I had to use my own milk, as I sometimes like to use water over milk, especially when I'm sick and milk is not good to have when you're sick.  The only other complaint is that the bag is difficult to use. A can would be much more user-friendly.	0	0
-1	B003MW7858	A2VUD4SPJO4V33	The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?	I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.	0	0

I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."	6	1

-1	B0030H1WW0	A17Y6PHLBMQOF6	It's just watery hot chocolate....	I don't know why they call this coffee - it's watered down hot chocolate with a bit of coffee flavor thrown in.  While I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate with a shot of espresso now and then this has nothing to do with that.  It's watery (even on the small cup setting), has almost no coffee flavor, and a very odd aftertaste.<br /><br />I would avoid this flavor k-kup if you're looking for cafe mocha or hot chocolate.	0	1

It was unique, a nice change of pace, with plenty of fizz and everything we'd expect from a sparkling juice.<br /><br />We served this to guests as well and some of them wanted to know where we'd gotten it so it was a hit with them. On hot days, it is particularly appealing, served nicely chilled. The Blackberry taste was easily identified by everyone who sampled it, even before I noted the flavor. A nice, tempting alternative when you want a refreshing beverage.	1	0

I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.<br /><br />This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7"" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.<br /><br />In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach."	18	8

1	B005O8BJW6	A29SA1GYR78W2I	Interesting texture and super-yummy!	"My 6-month-old daughter loves all the ""Brekkie"" blends and we love knowing she's getting to experience a slightly different texture and a very different flavor as well.  I also love feeding her something knowing that I would enjoy it too, it helps me feel like I'm offering her the best (although I will feed her things I personally think are gross, because I don't want to limit her palate at all).  The pouches are the most convenient way to feed her too.  It helps keep the mess to a minimum and when used in conjunction with the Boon dispensing spoons, it turns feeding into a one-handed endeavor!  I was so excited to be able to introduce some different stuff once we got past the basics to check for allergies and all the exciting flavor profiles offered by Ella's are exactly what I wanted as a foodie mom.  Taste preferences develop at a surprisingly young age, so it's important to introduce lots of different flavors as soon as you can and thanks to all the modern baby food blends, I can find such a wide variety!

-1	B005JSTDCE	ATRHFOV3P2G5T	If only it came unsweetened	I wanted to love this product, I really did. The company is awesome to deal with. It's a great price. I love the easy to use can. I just don't like how it tastes.<br /><br />The problem for me is that this coffee is presweetened. I knew that going in, but when I tried it, I found it was too much for me. Another factor is that saccharin is not my coffee sweetener of choice.<br /><br />I plan to keep an eye on this company in the future. As soon as there's an unsweetened option, I'm so there.	0	0

-1	B005A1LGIY	A37LNXZ3U8Z0PW	I'm a Crystal Light lover and I won't be buying this flavor... ever	I'm a huge fan of Crystal Light.  I always have a pitcher full in the fridge and a packet in my purse for my water bottle.  I was so excited to try this new flavor but unfortunately for me... this one is a fail.  The flavor smells alright but the flavor tastes fake, for lack of a better work.  Initally, when you take the first drink it reminds me of a jolly rancher.  The flavor is very strong.  Before I even swallowed the first sip I was overwhelmed with the thoughts of a fake almost plastic taste.  The aftertaste is just awful.  I unfortunately don't have anything positive to say about this flavor and am absolutely sure that I won't be purchasing this flavor.... ever.	0	0
-1	B0026KPDG8	A3H9W7E1T0AVD0	The Salt & Pepper version is awful!	"We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.  I would not have thought that ""salt and pepper"" would have been so incredibly heavy on the pepper.  Our mouths were burning and it wasn't a good burn!  We will continue to buy Popchips but never the salt and pepper variety again."	1	2
-1	B00139ZPKM	A31SM99AQNXDTG	I wish my dog liked it	Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand.	1	1
1	B003EML8PM	A1Y3X25CIAAZFT	Wonderful fresh	These Lowrey's Bacon Curls are wonderful.  They are so fresh, great tasting.

1	B007PA30ZU	AQQLWCMRNDFGI	Nice bold taste	My partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her K-cup coffee (my bad, since I'm the one who buys the coffee), and she requested something with a bolder taste. So, I tried this. We have used Green Mountain Coffee before, but not this particular product.<br /><br />Bottom line. My partner really enjoys this. The taste meets her expectations. Indeed, although I am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low, I have also tried this on occasion--and I, too, am satisfied.<br /><br />So, if you want a bolder flavor, this is worth considering.	1	0
1	B000KFXEYE	A1NH8W1SDIAVHE	Great Cocoa	This is the perfect cocoa to sit by a fire/listen ot the rain/cuddle next to your loved ones.

-1	B00622CYTK	A3BQTOHABBTGNL	Packaging for delivery needs to be better	I received my first order of Earth's Best Vegetable Variety 12- pack and one of the jars were completely shattered spilling pureed peas and brown rice onto half of the other jars. I had to VERY carefully clean, wash and inspect all the other jars to make sure they weren't also broken or have any glass pieces stuck to  it. And when I am ready to use a jar to feed him, I inspect it again before feeding. Now that I think about it, I should just throw it all away to avoid any risks. I normally make my baby food at home but thought these would be convenient for on the go feedings. My 7 month old son seems to like everything and has not rejected any foods I've given him, yet. *knock on wood* Anyway, I'm sure this stuff is good. But if I decide to buy it again, it'll be in the stores.	0	1

I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain.	1	3

-1	B005CUU25G	A30VOG29YPU59V	Might Be Good For Smaller Dogs - Not My 3 Large Ones.	I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs.	1	0
-1	B004FEJ968	A2LWIG18BWDXO8	Name is misleading-Hard to identify what is really is by package	"ok, when i saw this, i first thought ""cranberry fig newtons"", hooray. This is a cross between a fruit roll up snack and a flatbread biscuit.  The fruit was very tasty and chewy and the best part.  I had to dunk the cookie into milk to soften it up a bit and smooth the texture since it was very dry.  While it is good, i would choose something else as a snack if I had a choice.  This is not a ""fruit thin"", it's biscuit with fruit.  I wasn't even sure what to expect by the packaging.  Either make the cookie more like a cookie or make it a flavored biscuit in a different shape (like for high tea).  But I did eat them all and enjoyed every bite."	0	0
-1	B001EPPYHO	A12K79HZGK3XQV	Neither Orange nor chocolate flavor	We bought this from a candy shop a couple of years ago. Make no mistake - this is not chocolate and it has no chocolate flavor. The orange in its name refers to the color it changes - not to its flavor.<br /><br />The directions call for you to mix the powder with hot water. If you do this it will taste terrible. It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.	50	1
-1	B000E63LME	AGSC327PXS3W6	Disappointing. They really cheapened this product!	"The ""most critical"" review says:<br /><br />Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange!<br />The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry!<br />- - -<br />A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different. As stated above, they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare. I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags. I wondered how they could do this. What I got before was 5 flavors, 4 tea bags each. Yes, 5 times 4 = 20. How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags? Well, I found out today when I received the package, the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags, being two of the better flavors, Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion.

It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.	0	0

-1	B000I1YJRG	A17BNXSBGMUO1Z	Food or a chemistry lab?	"What offends me most about this product isn't just the ingredient list that sounds like it comes straight from a mad scientist and takes a lot of reading to even reach anything that sounds remotely like food: I've come to expect that from today's mass market food. What offends me is the blatant misleading marketing. Not only does the package look fancy and have a fancy name, and not only does it say ""A European Classic"" (this is an American product), and not only does it say ""Gourmet Hot Cocoa"" (because at an expensive restaurant I always ask the chef for ""corn syrup solids""), but worst of all ""Savor the flavor of old world style chocolate"": because I'm sure in the old world they mixed a nice helping of partially hydrogenated soybean oil and silicon dioxide into their hot chocolate.<br /><br />Someone gave me a package of this stuff and I'm debating whether or not to eat it, so I can't comment on the taste. But the misleading advertising alone, combined with this chemistry lab of ingredients, deserves one star no matter how it tastes."	2	4
-1	B005T697MC	A1Z8YX4WOIFU6Q	Best I have tried of the exploding soups	I have found that the Healthy Choice soups are not a good soup for the microwave.  Of all I tried this one is the best, it only explodes or jumps around a little bit, and usually no mess results if you wrap the container in paper towels.  Something in the Healthy Choice soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave.  This rice based soup recipe does not seem to have as severe of a problem as some of the other recipes I have tried.	0	0

1	B002NHYQAS	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Excellent - NOT bitter at all and very rich!	I'm a huge chocolate fan. It's my favorite sweet. I like all types - and this one is really scrumptious. It's rich and creamy without that bitter aftertaste I associate with so much dark chocolate. It's not exactly melt in your mouth but neither is it extremely hard and crunchy. It has a nice texture and I found it very pleasant.<br /><br />It is rich so I don't think I could eat the whole bar at once. I wish it was breakable in smaller chocolate squares - as it did not break off evenly for me. I love organic products and chose to buy them whenever I can and money allows. Everything is better with chocolate!	0	0

No roaches entered the boxes for a whole week (checked everyday) despite the ""pheromone formula"". It did however start trapping roaches after I added some ""bait"" (Doritos crumbs). So don't expect it to attract roaches on its own.

-1	B001TLY7DK	A22ZON5WZLACLH	Makes my dogs sick	While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.	3	1

Is it a hair straightener? Is it simply for nourishing the scalp? It's hard to tell since there are no directions. Open the container, however, and dip your finger into the contents and be prepared to spend a bit of time trying to remove the residue. My fingers were greasy, and remained so after scrubbing them with soap. I didn't even consider placing this in my hair.<br /><br />Based on the ad on Amazon that show an African-American woman, I assume this product is for African-American hair. It was surely not for me, hence the rating of one star."	1	1

At first, I was not impressed- thinking that I just overpaid for some upgraded Folgers- but then I figured it out. The secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches- At first I was making 4-5 cups at a time in my small coffee pot- then I cut that back to a two cup using approx. 3 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee- It was AMAZING!!! The depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable. Definitely something worth trying at least once- I for one will be looking forward to the next time I can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee...	6	0
-1	B008O3G2GG	AIX91OJ0O3BV2	A so-so reaction from our dog	I guess the idea here is that you can reward your dog with quick and tasty lick of a thin liquid on a roller ball. Seems like a decent idea, especially if you're trying to train your dog.<br /><br />The problem, in our case anyway, is that our dog is sort of lukewarm on this treat. He'll lick it sometimes, but other times, he just isn't interested. I asked him why, but he declined to comment.	0	0

My home smells of fresh coffee beans.  With Amazons free shipping how could I go wrong.  A little over $7.00 per pound?  You can hardly buy Folgers at that price even on sale!  I will be buying from Coffee Bean Direct many more times in the future if they keep these prices down.	3	0
1	B003E728CE	A3VD9NNS8YT4HB	Wish I would have found these years ago!	OMG!  Why has my vet been keeping these from me?  My vet's office doesn't keep these out where they can be seen but they do sell them.  I only found out about them when I mentioned that giving my cat a pill is not fun.  The receptionist gave me a couple to try.  The cat swallowed that thing so fast, and loved it.  Every vet should offer these routinely when they prescribe pills to cats and dogs.  It really makes life so much easier for me and for my pet!  I'm ordering some from Amazon so I have them on hand for the future.	0	0

They aren't exactly low fat/calorie and they are prone to crumbling a bit (whether shipped through Amazon or bought at the grocery store), but Pamela's Products fulfills their promise of making gluten free food taste great.  These are a *must try* for anyone with Celiac Disease or gluten issues!	0	0
1	B001D6KP14	ABK2RVDJPL8MF	very good	I was very happy with the way this turned out. It is very similar to traditional American beers(Bud/Coors) but with an extra kick. The flavor is very smooth, has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes. This is a great beer to start with for new brewers and veterans alike. If you are to anxious to wait for it to age, you can drink it after 2 weeks. It will taste good, but get better with age. Make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates. Lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions.	14	0
-1	B000JSQ66U	A37FDNDVN1JF07	Heavy on the nutmeg.	I've used several brands of Garam Masala in my Chicken Tikka Masala recipe, and this one is by far the heaviest on nutmeg.  If you're a fan of nutmeg, that's fine, but it does leave a slight aftertaste and it doesn't appeal to me quite as much as others.<br /><br />The smell of the spice mix is nice (again, heavy on nutmeg scent), and the consistency is good. There were no lumps and it did seem fresh enough.  Overall, I'd buy it again if I still can't find the stuff I used to buy near my home.	0	0
-1	B0045G8KJ8	A1RVACT1QE0MLG	The taste has changed	"I am a long-time consumer of Del Monte canned products, and their 100% Juice Sliced Peaches have been my favorite as long as they have been produced.  It has not been uncommon for me to eat an entire can in one sitting, several times a week.  Not any longer...  Several months ago, this item started sporting ""Improved Taste!"" on the label.  When I first saw this, I wondered what they changed; the ingredient list is short, the way I like all of my ingredient lists: peaches, peach juice, pear juice, natural flavor, ascorbic acid.  (If I could get it without the ""natural flavor,"" that would appeal to me even more.)  I do not know if they have a new source of peaches or juice or ascorbic acid, a new formula for the natural flavor they add, or a new process, but whatever they did, improvement is not a word I would use to describe the change.  My mouth still waters when I think about what used to be, but I am sorely disappointed each time I eat them now.  I do not like the new flavor, and I am left with a strange aftertaste.  This does not happen with other foods or beverages, so this is due to the product, not me.  When my current supply is gone (and I plan to give them away to speed up the process), I will not be buying any more.  Since the change, I have bought them at various times from Amazon, local grocery stores, and discount supercenters, just in case the issue stemmed from certain batches or storage conditions, but the flavor has been consistently bad.  You may not agree, and should not be afraid to try them, especially if you value short ingredient lists, as I do, but I certainly would not recommend buying a large quantity until you know for sure.<br /><br />  Another reason I chose to post a review was to agree with a posting by Rooster Eberle on 8-31-12 informing customers of multiple Del Monte canned peaches shipments he received from Amazon which were dented and dirty.  My July 2012 order of two six-packs was received in the same condition, and I canceled Subscribe and Save on this product because of it.  I threw away several of the cans, and decided I would rather hand-select my cans in a local store.  They were, indeed, in very bad condition.  I did separately contact Amazon about this recently.  Hopefully Rooster will post if future shipments arrive in better shape.<br /><br />  I have to add that I am a long-time Amazon Prime customer who places frequent orders of many types of items, and 98% of the time I am extremely pleased with products, service, and shipping.  I brag about Amazon to my friends, and suggest that they might want to become Prime members, also.  So this is not a case of sour grapes about any aspect of Amazon, just a case of sour peaches..."	0	0
1	B000GFYRI0	A1BKJNAWJT2TG2	THE best chai on the market & great packaging too!	"I absolutely LOVE Bigelow's spiced chai tea.  It's the best brand on the market, and along with their vanilla chai, form 2 of the 3 brands of chai I keep on hand (or will even TRY these days.)  Too many times, I've tried other brands, only to end up throwing them out because of dreadful medicinal tastes.  I also love the foil packet packaging inside the box--it makes Bigelow tea bags much more portable!  This is a tea that I hate running out of.<br /><br />I'm a camper, and frequently participate in outdoor activities.  I'm also usually the camp cook.  Bigelow teas are my favorite to keep in my drink box to offer everyone a selection of tea--the foil packages prevent taste transfer, help keep the bags clean and dry, and are clearly labeled as to the variety.  I feel comfortable adding Bigelow teas to our backpacks too--the teas will be usable whether they are used this trip...or six trips from now.  Convenient, fantastic flavor, high quality, and Amazon offers a much better price than our local stores.  I love the convenience of ""subscribe & save"" too!"	0	0
1	B003GTR8IO	A21W7ZA2FZKOGP	"Even good for a ""flavored"" coffee!"	Normally I despise flavored coffees -- I'm a coffee purist. I do have to admit that I'm quite fond of this Vanilla coffee however. It's not so strongly flavored as others and the flavor is smooth and pleasing. The aroma of the vanilla is nice too. I'd purchase this coffee again.	0	0
1	B001TNXSZG	A1H4R7TY2G50DH	Tastes like green tea from the jungle	"This stuff is hard to explain.<br /><br />It seems most similar to green tea, but it has an earthier taste, nuttier maybe. I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.<br /><br />I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green ""tea"" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.<br /><br />It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.<br /><br />This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.<br /><br />I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland. And this stuff is a welcome change of pace that is a pleasant and mellow taste."	7	1
1	B003ANFMY8	A36JDIN9RAAIEC	Don't fall prey to fads and anecdotal reviews	I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.	2	0

It is very creamy and it you weren't told that it was powder mixed with water, you couldn't tell the difference.  The only draw back is that you have to eat it after its mixed.  I tried to make a little extra for later and the consistency changed.  Just prepare the amount you plan on consuming and it is very good.	0	0

-1	B0019H0YZ4	A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4	No DHA or ARA	I'm only giving this three stars because it lacks DHA and ARA.  It does contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), the precursors of DHA and ARA.  However that means the baby has to convert these into DHA and ARA, something humans don't do well (that's why we need to get DHA and ARA in our diet and why they are in breast milk).  Nature's One does make a seperate supplement to provide DHA and ARA for your baby and I would consider this a must-have if you use this formula.  Otherwise find a formula that contains these critical fatty acids.  Similac has an Organic formula with DHA and ARA and I'm sure there are others.	11	6

-1	B003XDH6M6	A306153FTKS9PL	not sweet, a bit pasty	"This is an interesting product. My advice, if you're looking for an alternative to ""candy"" licorice or twists, you'll want to avoid this. If you're looking for a better type of licorice, than this product might be good for you.<br /><br />I'd describe this product as ""old-fashioned"". It seems to be made in a way in which many mass-produced licorice products aren't made anymore. Most interesting are the ingredients: organic wheat flour, organic sugar, elderberry extract, and pomegranate juice concentrate. While ""organic"" isn't necessarily any more healthy for you than non-organic products, the ""wheat flour"" is very interesting, and probably helps add the 2g of fiber to each serving.<br /><br />If I had to describe the taste -- I'd say ""sour"". The first piece you eat will be ""curious"", but if you eat an entire 5-piece serving (3.5 serving in the package), the flavor actually improves. I do think the use of wheat flour makes them a bit ""pasty"" or ""chalky"". And pomegranate isn't necessarily sweet -- so expect a tart experience.<br /><br />Bottom line -- the kids won't like this, but health-conscious adults may."	0	1
1	B005GTSXPY	AY12DBB0U420B	Pure Food For Those Who Control Their Diets.	I just had a bowl of split pea soup for a part of my lunch. It was Amy's Organic Split Pea Soup and it was quite good. It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.<br /><br />Gary Peterson	0	0
1	B001E53UTS	A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI	Fresh and Sweet, Delivers Zero Calories and Ten mg of Caffeine Per Serving	Lipton Green Tea to Go, energized blackberry/pomegranate offers a fresh-tasting delicate sweet tea that delivers zero calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product, the manufacturer states, is made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors, and is, as well, easy to prepare; just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  I find the caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love the berries of summer, all of them, blueberries, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy.  However, in the  list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  Of course, I'm not a dietitian, I just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.	1	0
1	B001P05K8Q	A2AI5PYD1UZA8G	Great for cleaning teeth and my dogs love them.	"I've been using these for almost a month now and just ordered some more.  I have two labs so I split one between the two of them every day.  They LOVE them.  Ok, they love any treat, but seem really excited by these.  One lab already has good teeth, the other does not.  Plaque covered the surface of all of her back teeth.  While the plaque is not 100% gone, it is greatly improved, probably about 75% of it has been removed.  I'm hopeful that with continued use, it will get even better.  Also, this product does not give my dogs intestinal ""issues"" as other rawhide treats have done in the past.  Only downside is that these chews are not consistently the same size or thickness.  Great product, I am hopeful to spread out dental cleanings more as they are pricey and require the dog to be put under."	2	1

-1	B003JOAOAU	A2N4P0XHG72D6A	Good spices, poor packaging and shipping	I am at a loss as to why they package these spices the way they did. You know those spice jars you buy at the dollar store with the little clear plastic shaker top inside the black top? These spices don't have that clear plastic top inside, or a safety seal. When you receive these, they are literally just a glass jar of spices with no seal and a loose fitting black screw cap. I assume this is why the whole jar is wrapped in at least 3 feet of bubble wrap. Even so, as other reviews for this brand have noted, they leak. Any why wouldn't they? I consider myself lucky because only one of the 6 spices I ordered had leaked, and it was only slightly. This must have been because of the inordinate amount of bubble wrap - there was so much that I actually felt guilty for ordering so many jars and having wasted so much plastic.<br /><br />If they just put either a shaker cap or at least a vacuum safety seal they wouldn't need to use so much plastic (truly a ridiculous amount), and the other reviews of spilled spices wouldn't be a concern.<br /><br />On to the spices themselves...very fragrant but I have only used one so far, the herbs de provence. It was good, and for the price I would continue to buy it although I do think I like the Frontier organic spices better, even if it is just for the jar (with the shaker!).<br /><br />Summary - be wary of ordering until they add a seal or a cap inside, so there isn't so much plastic. I buy organic because I care about the health benefits, but I also care about the environment and lack of pesticides, and all this plastic negates even buying these.	0	0

-1	B002MYQLVY	A16X101Q4APSUY	Cinnamon	My coworkers and I purchased this cinnamon to create gingerbread ornaments with our students.  We mixed the cinnamon with applesauce (something we've done for years) but as we mixed we discovered this cinnamon to have many pieces of white fibers mixed in!  The white fibers looked like tiny, white strings.  We continued on with the project because we knew we would not be eating it but soon we discovered, the cinnamon didn't even work for the ornaments.  The ornaments crumbled apart once they were dry rather than sticking together.  Lets just say, I'm so thankful we did not purchase this cinnamon to bake with or to eat!!  We were so excited to the GREAT deal on cinnamon but in the end it was not worth it.  We have had to repurchase cinnamon at our local grocery store.	2	0
1	B00503DP0O	ATQ22E6YAUNXP	Surprisingly delicious	"My husband and I are backpackers...so we have carried a variety of bars with us while we are out hiking.  This includes Quaker bars, Luna bars, Cliff bars, Zone bars, etc. So, because I like to change it up, I thought I would give these bars a try, even though they don't carry the protein I am use to.  Additionally, I liked the claim of these bars:  These bars are gluten free, are a good source of fiber, have 9 grams of whole grains per bar, include 180 mg of omega 3 fatty acids, and are sweetened with agave and coconut sugar.<br /><br />The bars themselves come packaged in your usual packaging, and this design is quite attractive as far as designs go.<br /><br />When I saw the bar itself, I was a little skeptical.  It looked more like a moist, waxy, lump of ingredients than the solid ""granola"" bar I was use to.  However, I continued on ahead in the tasting adventure.  Additionally, they are decent sized and the numbers of carbs, sugars, and fat are comparable to smaller bars--so I feel like you are getting more bar to eat than other brands for the same nutritional intake.<br /><br />As far as taste?  I've got to admit.  I was amazed at the taste.  These bars are delicious!  They have more of a fresh quality about them than your usual granola bar.  The combination of the oatmeal and the coconut work well together.  You taste those two flavors over the chocolate.  It's hard to explain---but I give an A + to taste, texture and size.  Texture is very soft and chewy, so easy to eat.  (Other bars have made my jaw ache from chewing).<br /><br />I would purchase these bars again and I'm excited to try additional flavors."	0	0

1	B0089Q2AAA	A1GWZ75BJ1INV3	Popcorn lovers -- you really should try this	I love popcorn but after trying these, I don't know if I should ever bother popping corn again.  The taste of these is wonderful and I really like the crunchiness of the chip.  Best of all, however, one can have them anytime by simply opening a bag.  While popcorn can be popped, stored and eaten later, good as it is, it is never quite as good as it is freshly-popped.  These taste great however, and I would rank them very close to freshly popped popcorn -- add convenience and crunch and they pull ahead in my eyes.<br />Note that I am really basing my comparison on the Kettlecorn variety so I, perhaps, shouldn't be comparing it to plain popcorn, but I would rate this against regular kettlecorn similarly, and I suspect that the regular popcorn varieties would hold their own.<br /><br />The additional sugar in the Kettlecorn version weighs in at only 3g in a one-ounce serving so despite the great taste, it isn't exactly drenched in sugar.  If you love Kettlecorn or popcorn, you should give PopCorners a try.	0	0
1	B000GZW9PI	A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO	Tasty	This package contains rice noodles & a flavoring pack, so you need to add your own cooking oil & (if you wish) egg, chicken or shrimp or vegetables or tofu & possibly lime, chilli, cilantro.  So, it's authentic as far as it goes but...I've been to Thailand 4 times & I think this product is pretty good, but I'm not a purist.  So, I often add some salmon, mushrooms, mixed veggies, or whatever else I happen to have handy.  The sauce is pretty strong so you can add a fair amount of things without demeaning the overall flavor of the dish.  It doesn't take long to make either.  I try to save washing so I use a big pot & a collander, not a frying pan or wok.  This dish is tasty but NOT spicy hot--like many other Thai foods--unless you add your own peppers.  Thai Kitchen makes other flavors too.  Enjoy!	5	0

I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.

These are Oatmeal Raisin nutrition bars, designed for a healthy snack or when you don't have time for breakfast.<br /><br />Overall, these are rather dry and they do crumble easily if you drop your lunch bag. The oatmeal and raisins are the main flavor, but if there is cocoa in them, it's not very much. They may be healthy for you, but they could definitely use some more flavor in them. They are an OK snack or breakfast substitute or when you just need something to tide you over till your next meal.	0	0

That notwithstanding, the taste was good, if a bit sweet for my liking.  Inspection of the label indicated that the aforementioned particles were, in fact, ""green tea leaves.""  The product comes from Taiwan, so perhaps the culture there doesn't mind a pulpy beverage.  Again, not bad, but a whole bottle--which isn't that big--contains a somewhat high caloric content of 120.  Would probably be better without the cane sugar added in."	1	0
-1	B00020XNUW	A2EK7J6I4QRFSZ	Not Entirely Pleased with This Batch	I think I received a bad batch of Manon Cafe and Manon Blanc--they were a bit squished and tasted maybe past their prime. Heat wasn't a factor in the shipping process--I ordered these in January in Seattle. Or, maybe these chocolates have a different consistency than the other assortments. In the future, I think I'll stick with their Milk Chocolate or Dark Chocolate assortments.	0	3

I enjoy instant oatmeal for breakfast or for a snack; however, often brands (Quaker for instance) include too much sugar and other additives. I love Dr. McDougall's oatmeal because it's organic, it has much less sugar but it's still very flavorful, it has lots of real fruit pieces, and it has nutritious grains.

1	B000CONMBS	A35IV2UGXLSKFU	Highly Addictive	There should be some sort of Surgeon General's warning on these they are so good. With all the high fat and high sugar cheeze puffs most people are used to these may taste somewhat bland at first bite, but believe me you'll be craving it soon enough. I offered my neighbor a handful and even though he thought they were just okay he came back ten minutes later and asked for an entire bag. My dorm room is full of sugary pop tarts and rice krispy treats, but I always go for these first and I think that kept me from gaining too much weight during finals.	1	0
1	B0026LN472	A3GIO61J5X9065	Healthy, cat friendly food.	My cats like this food a lot.  I am happy to give it to them because it seems to be very healthy for them.  I feed them the dry Natural Balance along with the canned which they are crazy about.  With this combination their coats are shinier and even their muscle structure is tighter and they look healthier and are doing very well.  Some former foods that I used left them always hungry.  With Natural Balance they are much more content.  As far as the cost is concerned,  I actually save money.  The food lasts longer because they eat less.  I have read this is  because they need less to meet their nutritional needs.  This does seem to be the case.  I recommend Natural Balance highly.	0	0
1	B000OV8OTY	A39IYGUCKAMVVC	Works great!	This item works a little too well in fact.  The little sticky traps are covered so I actually need to order more!  They work well because you are able to push them as far down into the pot as you need to unlike other traps you would just hang in the general area.  They seem to be helping control our gnat problem though I would recommend a pesticide to go along with them.  The sticky paper helps cut down on the number of flying adults but eggs still exist in the pot that need to be taken care of as well.	20	0

-1	B002AQP5FW	A12Y7IPRU7AZJP	Difficult to make, strange taste but good texture.	I just made this cake and I had to spend forever mixing! (perhaps that was because I didn't soften the butter). When it came out of the oven it was a nice golden brown color and smelled good. However, it's not really a cake in my opinion. Perhaps the rice flour made it taste like cornbread, but it definitely is not sweet or fluffy enough to be a cake. I like Bob's red mill cake mix much better. However I am still on the hunt for the perfect cake mix!	1	1

But I've found a few ways to describe this flavor:<br /><br />Sucking on brown saccharine?<br /><br />Chewing on stale aspirin?<br /><br />Someone dropped a cigarette butt in my water?<br /><br />Sweaty gym socks were wrung out in my glass?<br /><br />Someone left used motor oil on the bottom of my glass?<br /><br />This  drink is a great idea but a terrible rendering of such.  My teenager wanted to try it and I'm tempted to do a science experiment on him.  We call him Big Foot and I'm wondering if it would stop the growth of said feet.  I don't want him to stop growing taller (6'2"" now) so I wonder if I sprinkle it directly on his feet, if that would work?

1	B003VMY4KG	AX3T5TI76TOJ1	Full of vitamins & minerals, made with ingredients I can actually pronounce	I'm allergic to soy protein, and it breaks me out terribly. I'm very glad to find a nut-based bar w/ a little chocolate that tastes (and is) natural. They are SO addictive. We have literally bought over fifty boxes of these in only four months! I never get tired of them. Fabulous post-workout food. You get crunchy, chewy, salty, sweet in perfect balance, with nothing too strong, in this bar. The box of bars is very fresh. There's no chemical or artiffcial taste w/ these. They aren't huge, but are bigger than modern-day granola bars, and they're perfect as a snack or w/ a light lunch. Carrying one in my purse as an emergency snack is something I'll do in all but the summer months. Way better, and far less dry, than all the granola bars I've eaten, too. Seriously, compare their ingredient list, protein content, sugar content & vitamin/mineral content to other protein or granola bars out there. I've eaten a lot of those different bars over the years- Quaker, Nature Valley, Pure Protein, Balance Bars, Zone Bars & more. These are superior in every way possible. I highly recommend them.	0	0
1	B000F6SNPS	A2JA2RLQXBWMCY	Natural OR Artificial Flavor, your choice	"So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a ""spice flavor not found in nature,"" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS"">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

1	B007M84S9C	AHTTGLGSN7T7P	My water alternative!	"I must say I am not someone who usually writes reviews, but I am making an exception because I finally discovered the perfect healthy drink product on the market and trust me when I hear about a new beverage I am quick to try it, kinda like the inner researcher in me ;) .<br /><br />I am an avid food and beverage label reader and Amara's ingredients are legit. The drink isn't 'fake healthy' like a lot of other 'healthy' beverage companies. It is the perfect mixture of health in a can and it's low calorie (low cal's are important to me, since I don't like to drink my calories). I love how Amara is like ""water +"". I am someone who tries to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and water can get boring, but I have found Amara to be my go-to as my water with a kick. I like that it is low in sugar, has a light zing of carbonation, and that I can drink multiple 16oz cans (can't do that with any liquid besides water) and it's never overwhelming nor boring. It truly is my water alternative and it is sure addicting.<br /><br />I will admit I was nervous to try Amara for a few reasons, one because it looked like an energy drink (I really dislike those). Two, because I am sensitive to caffeine, but I've never felt glittery or weird from the amount of caffeine in Amara (maybe because of the electrolytes it has and so I never feel dehydrated or off from it), and three because I am a runner and thought the carbonation would hurt my stomach, but surprisingly it never did and made me feel great during and after a workout! I even like to drink Amara in the morning on my way to work!"	0	0
1	B0009XPD64	A6YOTZ3XBZ6L4	Great Food For Dog's With Allergies	I love this food. It actually is the only food I have found that my dog is not allergic to. (except for an extremely expensive prescription diet) I have a boxer on this food. He is allergic to almost everything. However, he is not allergic to salmon or sweet potatoes making this food the perfect choice for him. All food related allergies have disappeared and his coat has improved tremendously. He still deals with outdoor allergies, but this food has shown a big improvement in him. The only issue I have had is that he packed on a few extra pounds, which he has now lost. I cut down his dry food amount and mix canned green beans and carrots in with the dry food so he has enough to eat without the extra weight. He loves it and eats every bite!	9	0

1	B004U7KPY0	A26A64X86VL1R4	Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!	Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample.	2	1
1	B003GTR8IO	A17UCHSMWI8USS	a bag of coffee doesn't need 300 reviews....	This one is pretty good and a good deal especially with the Amazon promotion going on right now.

Not artificial tasting, just a nice hint of flavor, very smooth.  That's how I like my coffee so this is a good buy for me.  A warning to those who are single...this is ground coffee so buying a lot at a time may not be a good idea.  My 2-pack both expire in May 2011 and at only one cup a day, I may not finish it by then.

1	B003CGJAIM	A3D8758YHIZAU0	Great Coffee/Shipping Rip Off	The coffee is great I've been drinking it for over six months now and ordering it off Amazon for the last four months. However I was truly dissapointed with the shipping charges from this supplier, Shelly's Boutique.  I order two boxes of the coffee and a sample pack of the other Organo coffee flavors and tea.  All three items were ordered from the same supplier. All three were shipped in the SAME US Post Offices flat rate shipping container. It delivered in less than a week from the date that I ordered.  The Rip Off - I was charged three times for shipping!! Once for each item in the flat rate shipping envelope! Considering I've ordered two boxes at time from other suppliers who've shipped both in the same package and only charged me once for shipping, I will not be ordering from this supplier again even if they offer my coffee at a lower price.

-1	B000CRHQN0	A28Y4323S3OZ06	Contains maltitol	"Initially I liked this product very much. I like the taste and texture, and the three shipments I've received have all been fresh. I have not had any problems with ""stale"" or ""chalky"" shipments as described by some other reviewers.<br /><br />However, I became suspicious of whether it is really ""low glycemic"" as claimed, because it tastes sweeter than one would expect for a sugar-free low-carb product. Looking more closely at the ingredients, I noticed that it contains maltitol, which is a ""sugar alcohol."" The maltitol in the product contributes 11 grams of carbs to each bar (for a total of 24 grams of carbs).<br /><br />I've read that if you're on a low-carb diet, maltitol should probably be avoided, because it is a carb, and it does have an effect on blood sugar.<br /><br />Also, maltitol can cause intestinal discomfort and/or diarrhea, if you're sensitive to it, or eat too much of it.<br /><br />I have switched to Greens+ High Protein bars (peanut butter flavor), which are fairly low glycemic for this type of product but do not have artificials sweeteners or maltitol. (And no, I do not work for Greens+).<br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist. You can google maltitol if you want to find out more."	12	3

-1	B006N3I79Y	A38NELQT98S4H8	I know the other reviewers really liked this, but I didn't...	"I like a fairly strong cup of coffee.  Since it's French Roast, and labeled as Bold, I assumed that Tully's version would be.  Unfortunately, to me, at least, it's pretty weak stuff.  It may be better if your Keurig can be set to brew a small cup size...ours is fixed at roughly 8 oz.<br /><br />I personally prefer:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBW"">Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso Extra-Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>,<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFT88"">Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast Decaf for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> and<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVAO"">Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> for decaf coffee.<br /><br />For caffeinated, I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ"">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>],<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ220I"">Coffee People Santa's Buzz K-Cup for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups</a> (when it's available), or<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />I think all six have much better flavor than Tully's French Roast."	4	0

1	B002IEZJMA	A3R9H6OKZHHRJD	Closest to the Real Thing	I'm presuming that one would only resort to canned coffee if there weren't any real coffee available- that's the basis on which I will review this drink.  I still prefer the real thing, but for a canned coffee, this really is not bad.  It's nice and strong, and it has less sugar than other coffee drinks.  I'd actually prefer even less sweetener, but I find myself to be a bit unusual in that.  In any case, this is the closest ready-made beverage I've found that tastes like real espresso.  I can definitely appreciate the convenience.	0	0

The aftertaste is awful - has a hint of decaf.  Now I have 39 left to get through - the trash may be a better place for these.  I'll never buy a Brooklyn brand of coffee again.	3	2

Each pea is perfect; no imperfect ones to toss out. The final result is mouthwatering. I made a big pot, threw in some vegetables, and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day.<br /><br />And, being organic and GMO free, wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag, it is a healthful contributory to the diner, not a questionable one.<br /><br />I'm really glad I discovered these split peas. I can't imagine anything better.	2	0

I was a bit leery after trying, and not caring for, the Rainforest blend, but this is nothing at all like that blend, it's just perfectly suited for my tastes.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've moved onto Fogchaser now, which is just a tiny bit stronger, and have a new favorite. ;)"	0	0

I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the ""natural"" and ""real"" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable)."	1	0

It was leaf green from AmeriColor rather than green from Ateco.  Furthermore, the bottles were all completely identical between the Americolor and other Ateco bottles in the bo.  I don't know if maybe they just remove the labels from AmeriColor bottles and add Ateco labels?  At any rate, you can save a few bucks by buying the cheaper AmeriColor since I think it's pretty clear that they are the same thing..."	34	2
-1	B000LKXCD6	A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR	not very yummy	I normally love this dish. It's one of my faves at the local Indian restaurant I frequent. But this version of it, perhaps because of what's required to market something in a foil bag and ship it all over thither and yon, isn't very good.<br /><br />It's thin, for one thing, and my first packet of it contained a whopping three chunks of cheese. Say what?! I love the cheese! Where's the cheese?! Added to the cheese shortage is the fact that the dish is a wee bit salty, and you've got a palak paneer that doesn't really light my fire. IF I combine it with a biryani from the same company, it's tolerable, but I normally like this dish with nothing more than a couple of slices of naan. Ah, well, live and learn.	7	2

1	B002YJ0118	A1VP8G8JHTRXTR	Actual theater popcorn -- this is it	I'm probably one of the most critical when it comes to replicating the movie theater experience at home.  You're looking at a guy whom has a motorized movie screen, projector, sound system, actual 4 head soda fountain and candy display.  So, matching the popcorn was a large task.  Initially I was stuck with buying popcorn and peanut oil.  Ya, it tasted good but no where near movie theater popcorn.  Then, I found Snappy Snappack's and Great Northern.  Greath Nothern was my first purchase.  I challenge you to read all the reviews on here.  I can assure you that those whom say the popcorn is too salty are correct.  The salt comes in a powder form mixed in with the seeds.  If you're careful you can separate the two with some effort.  Personally, I've gotten used to the salt but I can tell you that it is very salty.  The freshness wasn't a factor.  I have no doubt that others have gotten less than fresh popcorn.  Here's a warning:  when your package arrives, BE CAREFUL.  Don't just slice into it to open the box.  The people from amazon literally grab about 20 of the packets and drop them into a box.  I was at a city event where they were giving away free popcorn and snapped a picture of the popcorn they were using.  Snappy SnapPack: [...] This was not overly salted and tasted more like theater popcorn than great northern I think but they're both a toss up... it's super close.<br /><br />If you're unsure how big your kettle is... go by this: the 2.5oz is only good for one person.  The 2.5oz kettles are the ones you see like this:[...]<br /><br />You've seen them at places when you're out and about.  So in retrospect I should have gotten the 4.5oz one.  I have one of those small nostalgia popcorn cards.  2.5oz will fill up a large popcorn bucket about halfway.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this pre-packed popcorn is that it pretty much pops all the seeds.  When I used to pop popcorn from walmart popcorn and peanut oil it'd only pop about 50% of the seeds... the remaining seeds would fly out of the popper.<br /><br />There are some on here that talk about the buttery/oily mixture not looking fresh.  It does come as a semi-solid.  You don't need to kneed it, however.  Simply empty it into the kettle and it will melt on it's own.<br /><br />If you have any questions I'd love to answer them.  Just reply to this message.	4	0

-1	B001397WV2	A3OT1RIV0CRKDQ	Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!	I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.	41	6

This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang.	0	0

"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again. As noted the claims of ""no nitrites"" in the description are false: Beef, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy protein, Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed and Soy Oil, Caramel Color), Water, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Salt with Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed, Soybean) added), Dehydrated Garlic, Black Pepper, Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite).

-1	B002D4DY8G	A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J	good coffee but don't expect chocolatey flavor	the coffee itself is pretty decent and goes down smoothly. but my biggest problem with this product is how its described as 'chocolate truffle' because it's not chocolatey. if you want a combo of coffee and chocolate, this is NOT for you - make yourself a genuine mocha instead because you'll be disappointed. get this coffee if you want a decent brew, but don't get it if you expect a yummy chocolate flavor. labeling it as 'chocolate truffle' is grossly misleading because one expects amazing full-bodied chocolate flavor. you just can't get the creamy, sugary dimension of chocolate from ground coffee alone, so the product should be renamed.	0	0
1	B001E530FM	AE29A0NN7V5I0	Works, but still sticks to poop. Washable!	"I got my 6-pack in a larger bag that was packed in a cardboard box about 2 weeks ago - no tears or rips in any of the packs. Thanks to the Amazon Subcription Service, cat litter is now delivered to my door with free shipping and I don't have to lug a 20lb bag from the store anymore.<br /><br />Reason for the 4 stars: Poop still sticks to the pellets and I lose a few everytime I scoop, and it does not control poop odor. But that's ok, I just use an air freshener spray. I use 1.5 bags each time since 1 pack doesn't seem to be enough.<br /><br />Anyway, the pellets are washable! I was curious - so I tried and the pellets weren't all that dirty anyway as I had already scooped the dirty (pop-covered) ones out. I poured the used litter into the bottom part of an old hooded litter box that had hot water and detergent in it (I use the hood for the Breeze litterbox!). I let it soak for about 20 mins whilst I washed and dried the Breeze litter box, changed the pee pad, and poured in a new bag of litter. I used an old kitchen/dish brush that has a long handle and sort of ""scrubbed"" the used pellets in the soapy water for a few minutes and then drained the water into the toilet bowl and then rinsed it out a number of times until the water was clear. Drained it as much as I could, and then left the box in the bathtub with the window open to air-dry it, and closed the tub screen so my cat wouldn't think he had an extra litter box in the bathtub! The pellets were clean and completely dry within 2-3 days. Kinda interesting that it can be washed and we're not generating more garbage to pollute the earth. Plus, for anyone wanting to save some money...."	44	3

-1	B0018CE6DQ	AQ8KS8TEQJIGQ	I wouldn't buy any dog food made by Diamond (chicken soup is only one of many)	"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all."	1	1
-1	B007RTR8UM	A1QBOC76MIOJYP	No good for me	Shampoo and coditioners will always be something that works differently for different groups of people. For me, this version of Clear did not work well at all.<br /><br />My hair is long, to my waist. Not very thick, but pretty wavy. I don't use straighteners too often in the summer months, but I do use a blow dryer often and am in the sun alot, so my hair can get dry at times.<br /><br />A conditioner for me has to work well at detangling and moisturizing, but more emphasis on the detangling due to my hairstyles. Especially with my hair being so long, I need something that actually works, so that I am not using a whole bottle at a time. This is why I stick to salon brands since they are so concentrated. Every now and then I will switch to a drugstore brand, just to try something new though.<br /><br />Clear Scalp Volumizing Root Boost conditioner was horrible at detangling for me. I don't feel it was very good at conditioning at all in general. I had to use 3-4 heaping handfuls at a time and even then it just did not seem to be doing much. This Clear conditioner is very thick and rich, but it just didn't perform well for me. My typical shower routine is to shampoo, then wash my face, then apply conditioner comb it through and clip my hair up while I wash off. I like to let the conditioner soak into my hair. With this, it was much more difficult to comb through my hair with the conditioner on and my hair still felt rough/ragged.<br /><br />This conditioner seems like it isn't absorbed by the hair at all. It is like it just sits on top of it and then rinses right off. It does rinse easily with no apparent residue, so that is a plus. It didn't weight my hair down at all, but it also did not give me any volume. This could be because my hair is so long, but I do use other volumizing shampoo & conditioners and can see the volumizing effects. I tend to be flat at the roots, so in lieu of teasing or heavy use of styling products, I like to use a volumizing shampoo & conditioner from time to time for fuller styles.<br /><br />I had to follow up with a leave in conditioner every day that I used this. My hair is not overly dry, so it shouldn't have been such a big issue. I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck. This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly. It does smell good though, for what it's worth. It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.	0	0

1	B000I1OLT2	A3UUTDX2WNVUS3	Exquisite Tea	"I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what ""goji berry flavor"" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means ""the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional.""<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time."	1	0
1	B000H27K86	A32GR8OZLZF19V	Excellent, wish Safeway still carried it	"This is the best Cajun spice my wife and I have found anywhere, ever.  We have been using it for more than ten years.  It goes great on all sorts of things -- chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, or fried), baked potato, etc.  Not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  Whenever we fry something in batter or breading, Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.<br /><br />We've tried ""Slap Ya Momma"" and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  Instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  Luzianne's is definitely the superior implementation.<br /><br />We recently ran out of it, and to our dismay Safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other brands.  None have measured up, which is why I was searching for it online.  We're very happy to have found it again on Amazon."	1	0

-1	B000ER5D4M	A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	My Twin Babies Loved This One Right Away But Jars Kept Arriving Broken	I got the subscription and finally ended it after 7 occasions of broken jars in the delivery. I got tired of cleaning the mess and dealing with broken glass but the product is good even if watery.<br /><br />My babies love blueberries the most and over time they like pears and apples a lot too. This is a clear winner with them as it has only organic apples, organic blueberries and ascorbic acid. It's a great product.<br /><br />Be warned that your shipment could arrive sometimes with broken jars. I already said that! Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. When a case arrived with one or more broken jars, I reported and got credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken.	3	0

-1	B002IEVJRY	A29Z0B2L367ZO	Nothing noteworthy	I am really disappointed of this product. The closest way I can think of describing the flavor is like I imagine it would taste if I left an opened, half full can of cola overnight on the counter, so it is totally flat, and decided to mix it with yesterday's coffee left over. Does it sound appealing to you? Not to me. It is not totally gross, but far from good.	0	0
-1	B0029NUWA4	A3MNL5YQL3F4ER	Cat Killer!	I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!	2	4
1	B004OV6X6Q	A3MKPAIK06U60K	Vegan Chocolate Treat	I really like that these Pure Natural Bars are vegan and gluten free.  They have a good chocolate flavor and seven grams of protein.<br /><br />I'm currently pregnant and need to take snacks with me to keep my blood sugar steady and these work great for throwing in my purse.  They wouldn't hold up well in the car right now though with the heat we've been having.  The box that I received was a bit banged up and it was clear that some of the bars had melted a bit in transit.<br /><br />The only negative for me is the texture wasn't quite what I was expecting.  I thought the bars would have a candy bar type texture or maybe even a granola bar type texture but these are a bit more like a brownie bar.  I'm not crazy about the texture but overall these are a good snack to have on hand.	0	0

-1	B001397WV2	A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84	None of the five cats will eat it	"I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning ""I hate it."" I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means ""I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that ""I don'tlike it"" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them ""eat or not eat"" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular ""orange and white kitty"" and my ""sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'"" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where ""the special eating"" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever ""speciality of the evening"" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go ""aLookin"" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid ""nose sticker uppers."" But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole ""nother"" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by ""Cindy O"". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we ""come upon"" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried."	2	3

They disliked it the first two times so much that they refused to eat it.<br /><br />I feel that at least they were introduced to new foods that they'll probably like when they're a bit older.<br /><br />When I purchased this item, I was unaware it doesn't have anything sweet like all the other Earth Best flavor brands I've purchased.

At least they weren't raw onions.

-1	B002AMZ1EG	A1REG8971JNOIR	High hopes dashed	"On the seemingly endless search for a better alternative to traditional clay litters, I had high hopes for Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter due to the number of positive reviews regarding the product.  Upon opening the bag I found the litter had a pleasant woodsy-tea odor that was not overpowering. The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box.  Although the manufacturer describes the product as ""low in dust"", it is anything but.  In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much.  The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one?  The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size.  In summation:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor<br /> - clumps well<br /> - lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box<br /> - high dust<br /> - high tracking<br /><br />If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household.  Unfortunately, we have to give the product one thumb and two paws down."	44	4

1	B001BCXTGS	A15NS9ERV7LT7A	My Two Cats Inhaled The Stuff	OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.	2	1
-1	B0015YHFU8	A19VMMPVA2AI18	Salt & Vinegar chips	These chips did have a terrific bite but still a bit on the greasy side but that's what Kettle chips are. My all time favorite is the Lays salt/vinegar but no longer in the stores where I reside and the company on amazon that sells them only has the 1.5oz (too small) and by the time you pay shipping...not worth it. Overall the Madhouse Munchies not bad and the 5oz size is quite lg. There was a promotional special when I ordered so got the case at a great price on Amazon.	0	0

-1	B001UJEN6C	A1R2P21ZYNJCFJ	Not sure	I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others.	6	1
-1	B003UDS8FS	A31ABQG10QC5RM	Will not buy again!	I bought this food for my 2 german shepherd dogs after reading all the good reviews. Right after eating this food they both started itching and scratching like crazy! They also had very bad gas and were belching non stop. Needless to say the 3 of us did not get any sleep at all that night. There are way better foods out there for the same price, although just because it did not agree with my dogs does not mean it will not agree with yours. The ingredients in this food are way better than food you would find at wal mart though.	0	0

1	B000BF54MS	A29VH0XAI0VGJV	Can't live without it!	"Seriously, my family can't live without this chili. When we don't know what to cook - it's ""open a can of chili"" or when we need comfort food. I am not a vegetarian but my son and husband are... and I think I love it more then them."	2	0
-1	B005CUU25G	A3SMD3T0QTN109	I question its value	My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.	0	1
1	B002K62BUO	A2ZNUVRGCQHU9G	chocolate dipped dates	I found a recipe that called for these dates. It had orange spiced nuts and then they were dipped in chocolate. These dates were suppose to be easy to slice and get the pit out of and very flavorful. They lived up to all of that and more. They come sealed in a foil package for freshness. There are a lot in one pound and they do not need sugar they are sweet all by them selves.	1	0
1	B0035A11OQ	A25DVVKPSAT6BS	Blue Diamond Premier Dog Food is loved by my dog	This is great dog food.  My dog is very fussy about food and will usually only eat meat that I eat.  I had to find a high in nutrition dog food that was not full of fillers and corn meal etc.  This is the food your looking for.  It probably is the best on the market and my dog deserves only the best.  We humans wouldn't eat something that we didn't like and we are smart enough to know what is good for our bodies.  So we treat our pets the same.  We use to feed our pets Science Diet but have decided to upgrade to be a better dog food that he likes to eat.  I think it has much better flavor so my dog eats it.  Yes it is costs more but well worth the added 15 dollars per month cost.	1	0
-1	B004E4EBMG	AGEKVD8JPZQMT	It's Ok	I love flavored water, so I thought I'd give this a try.  It's a really neat idea and the bottle is small enough to fit in your pocket, a small purse, or your car console.  It has zero calories, sugar, etc., so it is a diet drink and tastes like it no matter how much or little you use.  The one thing I really don't like about it is that it does not drip out in small drops, you squeeze it and the least that you can squeeze out is about a full tablespoon, which means your water really can't ever taste like water with a touch of peach mango juice, it tastes like watered down peach mango juice.  I was hoping you could do smaller drops to get more of a light flavored water taste, but it doesn't work that way.	0	0
1	B0001M0YYO	A1HMWZI4N29GVT	This stuff will knock your socks off!	I first got this at a co-op I worked at a few years ago. Honestly it sat on my shelf for about a year before I got around to using it in some homemade chili. I put the same amount of the Hungarian Paprika the chili as I had with regular generic paprika in the past. Whoa Nelly! That stuff turned my mild chili into crazy hot! Everyone loved it. Since then I've repeatedly been asked to bring my chili to gatherings. When they ask what's in it I just say paprika. ;-)<br /><br />If you get this to replace regular paprika start with a smaller amount than the recipe calls for, say 1/4. Then work from there.<br /><br />Not only is it hot but it does have a wonderful aroma and flavor.	1	0
1	B000KC0XJQ	A2V3X6E6MYOFJW	XANGO is really helping us	This juice is a miracle in and of itself.  It is not a cure all.  My wife used to take high blood pressure medicine, but she no longer needs to.  She doesn't have trouble with heart burn or acid reflux since drinking this juice.  I used to have severe pain in my upper right side (probably gall bladder) every time I would eat--that doesn't happen anymore.  We have both noticed increased energy and we don't get sick as much as we used to.  We are very thankful for the people who told us about XANGO!!	6	0
-1	B000CQIDHY	A2XWDHTF1F8X3N	Too bitter	I hardly order chai teai, then I tried Tazo chai tea, due to the nice reviews on Stash brand  and cheaper price I went for it.  Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used  almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup.  It is very bitter!!! Be aware, and only buy it  if you like real real strong black tea.  As a matter of fact is more like black tea than  chai.<br /><br />Keep in mind I am not a tea expert, but if I like a nice cup of tea, and never have not finished one, like in this case.	2	2

-1	B004T3QMD8	A1517476XFOC7A	Very Weak, Watery Flavor Even When Lots Added	"I love lattes and pumpkin spice sounded like the perfect flavor to try at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I used a measuring spoon to ensure that I put in the correct amount, but the flavor was very watery.  Think iced tea diluted two to three times beyond the recommended amount.  The flavor was more what I would expect from a cheap ""pumpkin spice"" herbal tea rather than the usual ""International Coffee"" latte.<br /><br />I added 50% more powder, but the flavor got sweeter but not richer.  Overall, this was very disappointing, and my guests agreed.  None of us finished our mugs."	0	0
-1	B001D0KG4Q	AODIR5MR87QE8	I didn't care for this pack	1st off, this is what is in the box:<br /><br />Two of each per 24 pack:<br />-Parisian Nights extra bold<br />-Italian Blend<br />-Kona Blend<br />-Breakfast Blend<br />-Decaf Colombian<br />-Colombian Dorado<br />-Rainforest Expresso extra bold<br />-Hazelnut<br />-Chai Tea<br />-English Breakfast Tea<br />-Green Tea<br />-Lemon drink<br /><br />I bought this so my husband could try the teas (he is not a coffee drinker).  I paid about $.33 per K-cup which is a good price, however I thought the coffees were not that great.  I prefer the Green Mountain brand and I suspect for me, it will be worth it to pay a little more for them.	1	0
1	B001KVPBS4	AGFFSTP9402YQ	Chili? BS	"I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating ""Lime and Chili"" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.<br /><br />Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for."	1	0
1	B0056AL6G6	A1LNSC5R330F3N	I can't believe this is healthy food!	I'm so addicted to these fruit bars! I do not have the best diet, and I really don't like eating fresh fruit. That's It bars have changed all that for me. Now I can get 2 servings of fruit and feel like I'm eating candy. There's no added sugar - it really is just fruit! I also recommend it to my vegan friends. :)	3	0
-1	B000LRH9SI	A2A5WLTXWJDQ8T	Has yet to arrive	I have an FPO address so orders often take 3 weeks to arrive.  But it has been over a month since I ordered it.  I am still hoping it will come.  Until it comes, I really can't rate it, can I?  The computer just insisted that I rate it, so I gave it a one, although a failure to arrive is really a zero, isn't it?!	0	1
1	B000MURJR0	A22CW0ZHY3NJH8	Good spread	My son survives on this stuff. It's very chocolaty. I agree it is very sweet. I like the hint of hazelnut and I like it as a spread on crackers or toast. My son will eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich. It's good, especially for chocolate lovers.<br /><br />_______________<br /><br />UPDATE:  My son brought this to his childcare center and he was prevented from eating it because they are a peanut-free facility.  When I told them it was hazelnut spread, they said it smelled like peanut and it was processed in a factory that may have processed peanuts and it's a nut.  So, for those moms whose children go to schools where they are paranoid about nuts (not just peanuts but everything nuts and stuff processed at facilities which may have processed nuts), Nutella may not be acceptable.	2	1
1	B000F41ZFK	A2P2GK46TMJO61	For the perfect English 'cuppa'	Over many years, I regularly brought back English teas for my family of tea drinkers to sample including Fortnum's Royal Blend, Twinings English Breakfast and, more often than not, this Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea which became my family's overwhelming favorite. Now we share bulk orders of this beloved tea supplied by Amazon which arrives to my doorstep in perfect condition - the true UK product with a whopping 3+gr of tea per bag and a very favorable expiry date so the 6 individually wrapped cellophane packs of 40 bags will stay fresh for 18 months.  This Yorkshire Tea makes the perfect breakfast tea - the Assam/African tea leaves common to English Breakfast blended to create a rich, smooth, golden brew standing up well to a generous spot of lowfat milk (my English friends NEVER take whole milk with their tea!) In comparison with its rivals, Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea has 50% more tea per bag than the Twinings USA English Breakfast product. (Twinings USA cuts down the strength of its tea bag from 2.5gr per UK bag to 2.0gr for the USA product.) For eco enthusiasts, Yorkshire Tea is Rainforest Alliance certified. The Tea also holds a the Royal Warrant and is served in the renowned Bettys Cafe Tea Rooms in York. Now if Amazon would only import crumpets to complement my perfect Yorkshire cuppa!	0	0
-1	B001E0VC20	A3SP3F4YQYDPZ2	Not the best	So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.	0	1
1	B000ST9GCQ	A3PD8JD9L4WEII	Very convenient and good coffee (for instant)	I am one of the weird people who actually like instant coffee better than fresh brewed (in most cases), so these are a winner for me.  Very convenient and inexpensive in the long run, in that you only use what you need (how many pots of coffee have you dumped out?).  This pkg seemed to be one of the better values.  For anyone who needs a quick single cup of coffee, can't be beat.<br /><br />Thumbs up!	1	1
-1	B001E4S8GO	A3KUKHOZ2VXGND	Disappointing ingredients-TJ's is Better!	Yea, this tastes good, but for those of us who are very picky about the ingredients, and want to avoid Palm oil, try Trader Joe's natural peanut butter(TJ's is a cool store with a lot of their own brand of cool food & stuff); it tastes great is priced great, and has no palm oil, only peanuts and salt. You only have to stir it once. My family loves it and I need buy no other brand.	2	1

-1	B001EQ4I4I	AFMS268P1OV7K	A decent Kona blend	"This coffee is a good Kona blend comparable to other brands of 10% Kona coffee with ""Lion"" brand Kona blend being my personal favorite. While I generally prefer whole bean for the freshly ground brewing, I think the ""blending"" of Kona beans may be a little inconsistant and I found the Millstone ground 10% Kona blend to have a little better Kona flavor overall."	5	1
-1	B005VOONLW	A2KS0FVY2CNJ8M	Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.	I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.	0	0

1	B000084ETV	A28MG088LYIKHB	Wrong bag pictured	Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag. In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula. Woops! So I went and bought the 15lb bag of Chicken and Rice and mix the Beef and Fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system.<br /><br />I can say that after we started feeding this to my pup, she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before. Also, Roshan's right about the fish breath! Ick.<br /><br />Overall, my dog has no issues with this formula, it's just stinky so I'll stick to Chicken and Rice after this bag is done.	0	0
-1	B000EY3OMS	A2N4GVMIUXGZT1	Awful	This mustard is horrible. There is an inverse correlation between the absurdly inflated price of this shameful mustard and its quality. It has a nauseating garlic taste and absolutely no mustard flavor (the quintessential turmeric taste, which is the recognizable taste of mustard, does not even register, for example). Essentially, the manufacturers made sure this mustard LOOKED impressive by trumping up a stone-ground appearance. This is how they hook the customer into paying the inflated price. The value of the mustard ends with the appearance, though. We found it so disgusting that we threw it in the trash. Shameful.	0	4

-1	B000MXJR72	A2L0JPZWFTJZ87	Tuna oil?	If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.	3	0
-1	B000CNMUP8	AE9M5M39Y94LU	Ok for an oolong	This tea tasted okay for an oolong.  I was looking for something a little fresher tasting.  It helps to steep the tea for less than 2 minutes.  The packaging is sturdy and pretty.  This will probably make about 60 cups of tea since the leaves can be reused up to 3 times.  (It actually tastes better the second and third brewing.)	0	0

In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.  He had never been diagnosed with any food allergies but after buying a large box of commercial treats to keep at the hardware, we started to notice some problems.<br /><br />A local pet store recommended another flavor of these treats.  He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!	1	1
1	B00438XVGU	A11GAMN6HED4U1	Great Instant Coffee	As usual, Starbucks does a great job with coffee. One pack of the Italian roast can still make a pretty good 16oz cup of coffee. It's better as 8oz - 12oz but you can get away with 16oz. I tried the Taster's Choice and regretted it. The Taster's Choice is half the price but you need at least 3 TC's packs to equal 1 VIA and it's still not that good. Spend the extra couple of dollars on Starbucks. You know it's worth it.	1	0

-1	B0014WYXQK	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	A Decent Alternative To Soda	Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a nice alternative to the normal breeds of soda such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Dr. Pepper.  It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.<br /><br />The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.<br /><br />In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.  Give it a shot if you are looking for a Coca-cola subsitute.	0	0

-1	B005A1KZC2	A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE	A rather boring combination of snacks	"Gluten-free is the new black and for people suffering from celiac disease this can be a nice combination to give as a gift basket.<br /><br />While the snacks were tasty, these are all things sold at the corner grocery store these days.  Each item in this combination were either one or two servings of a product and weren't anything the least bit exotic or hard to get.  Everything except for the ginger snaps were national brands easily found (the ginger snaps were imported from England and did not have nutritional info)<br />Speaking of nutritional info, most of the items were high-fat and/or high sugar and weren't terribly healthy.  All were yummy and the popcorn was my favorite, but I only ate it in small doses since the sugar and fat was way too much for me.<br /><br />The packaging of the products was less than inviting.  A simple ribbon with a chipboard basket and brown paper scraps didn't exactly scream ""gift basket"".  I think the packing material the basket was packed it was more attractive than the bedding in this basket.<br /><br />If you are desperate to give a quick and easy gift to someone with gluten intolerance (congrats on the baby?), this fills the bill.  However, you'll save money and provide a more balancing and attractive alternative if you can do it yourself."	0	0

-1	B0062A87HA	AFKU54VTOF81V	Is this manufacturer using Amazon to close out damaged cans?	Our dog gets pumpkin in every meal -- if yours does too, you know why.  You also know that one can only stash so many cans of pumpkin, and that somewhere in the spring most supermarkets start running out of canned pumpkin and can't get more or stop ordering it (understandably).  So, I was happy to see this product on Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers experienced, many of the cans arrived dented. In fact ALL 12 CANS were dented, most severely so.  Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink-wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.<br /><br />This clearly indicates that the manufacturer -- or whomever wrapped the cases -- shipped already and obviously damaged cans.  I checked the product listing and there is no mention of these being seconds.  My message to manufacturer, distributor and/or Amazon: check the product or change the description so people know they are taking their chances.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon customer service came through with an offer to replace or refund.  I'm giving this one more shot for my dog's sake, and will hope for the best.	112	10
-1	B007OXJKF2	A2T5Y84ZTY0F7F	Not So Good..	I really wanted to like this flavor of K-Cups but it's just not that good. It smells incredible when it's brewing but I think that because this isnt a true flavored coffee you come in thinking its going to taste sweet. Its bitter to me and even the  undertones of the cinnamon seem a little tart. I tried even putting creamer and sugar and still found it to be too bitter. I love the regular and deacaff versions(unflavored) of Donut House coffee but this is not too good.	0	0

-1	B007OXJKF2	A26PCKTKJ7L24A	Total misrepresentation as far as flavor is concerned	"This is the first time I have taken the time to review something on Amazon.  This product is so bad that I consider this review to be a public service.  As the title indicates, to say that this coffee is cinnamon roll flavored is total misrepresentation.  There is a very slight scent of cinnamon roll while it is brewing, but the end product has absolutely no cinnamon roll flavor.  The end result is bitter black coffee and nothing more.  I have to wonder if the maker, Green Mountain Coffee, has ever heard of taste testers.  Based on the flavor of this coffee, and flavor of the equally bad ""Chocolate Glazed Donut"", I have to say no.  I think I will throw them away and take the loss rather than subject my taste buds to continued assault by choking down the remaining 23 cups.  The kindest thing I can say about this product is that it is absolutely terrible.  I intend to express my displeasure to the manufacturer as well.  For a product this bad it should be possible to give a zero star rating or better yet, a negative star rating.<br /><br />Based on my experience with both products I will be very reluctant to purchase another ""flavored"" coffee."	1	0

The taste of lime is barely there. I do like that this comes in single serve bags that pops well without burning, although I still get around 20 unpopped kernels each time.

1	B000BMDO6E	A1TMNIGFVJ32JL	The Only Thing Better Than . . .	"Jablum Jamaican coffee is Jamaica itself, especially the Sandals Resort at Ocho Rios. If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican ""blends"" offered in stores and on the Internet).

1	B002N2T0H2	A1J7EO5K0SN6ZH	Decent Alternative to Fancy Feast Appetizers (chicken and tuna)	I have one cat that absolutely adores Fancy Feast's Appetizers -- the chicken and tuna combination. The only problem is that Appetizers are small portions (2 ounces instead of 3.3 ounces), expensive (retailing at $1.49 per portion), and not a complete source of nutrition. Fancy Feast says the Appetizers should supplement regular cat food rather than replace it. But it's the one meal that gets my cat to clean his bowl.<br /><br />So when I discovered Soulistic cat foods being offered at Petco, I gave the Sweet Salutations Chicken and Tuna Dinner a try. More standard 3-oz can priced at 89 cents apiece, with complete feline nutrition. My incredibly picky cat will eat 90% of this. So it's a decent alternative to the Fancy Feast Appetizers that he craves.<br /><br />This particular canned meal has a lot of gravy, which pleases my cat but may not satisfy others who prefer more meat.<br /><br />Given Petco's shipping charges, I probably will continue to buy this at my local Petco rather than ship via Amazon.<br /><br />NOTE: The price shown here is for a tray of 12 cans.	1	0

After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the ""floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish"" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.

1	B003GTR8IO	A398R165PXFOSS	Smooth and tasty, but lacking vanilla	My husband drinks coffee plain.  No sugar.  No milk.  Just coffee.  I got this for him and he had me try it.  It is very smooth.  There is no bite, and when I initially put the mug to my mouth, I could smell vanilla.  What was disappointing was that I could not TASTE the vanilla.  I took a few more sips, but every time, I could only smell the vanilla and not taste it.  My husband really likes it because he doesn't feel like he has to do the teeth-clench-swallow.  He says the vanilla taste is very subtle, so perhaps I am just missing it.  Either way, this is a very smooth blend in our Keurig.  It brews very well - not weak like some of the other varieties we have tried.  It smells divine, and goes is a great morning perk-up!	0	0
1	B005356QHI	A2UIBQ4WM3MQTE	Great tasting stuff, but price maybe too high.	The teriyaki flavor marlin fish jerky is very, very good.

Of the three flavors, this is the best.<br /><br />But, at the stores here in Hawai'i, it sells for like $8 a bag.  $17 seems like a lot of markup.	1	1
1	B0030JFYYA	A2IDRAYYZ5GKBZ	Superb addition to a dog's daily diet	"This Preference veggie mix has been an important addition to our dogs' daily meals for the past 2 years.  I first began using one of Honest Kitchen's other products, Thrive, when our youngest dog (still a pup) was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia.  I chose to use a bunch of natural supplements/herbs to deal with his joint mobility/pain rather than twice-daily strong prescription meds that would destroy his liver.  It put him off his food though since he didn't care for the taste of some of the supplements; so I tried to add plenty of good-tasting, healthy additions to his kibble (Pure Vita) to encourage him to eat.  The ""Thrive"" dehydrated mix was convenient...meat and veggies together...and I still occasionally use it for that convenience when the dogs are being kenneled or kept by others.  For regular daily use though, I use the Preference veggie base and add my own chicken, turkey, salmon, or bison.  I find it a bit more economical to just add my own protein source since I go through quite a bit (2 dogs, and 1 is huge).  Another thing that I like about the Preference mix is that one of the first two ingredients is alfalfa which has been shown to help with joint inflammation...just what my big guy needs.<br /><br />I usually mix up enough for a couple days worth of meals and just keep it in the fridge.  I just scoop the appropriate amount into each dog's bowl and then mix in the supplements for each pooch.  I then stir in the meat and kibble along with salmon oil.  They love it and they're both doing great on it!"	0	0

The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale.

He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again.

1	B0018CLZBW	A1V0D3XFFNVPU2	Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull	I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).	3	0

-1	B006HYLW32	A2YDU3RZB63VXW	Holy SALT, Batman!	"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."	45	7

1	B0041NYV8E	A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	Far stronger than I expected	With my first sip I wondered how I am going to finish this strong drink. I used a whole packet for one cup. It took me a little while to finish this one cup.<br /><br />This is a very serious drink because of the ginger strength. Whereas I had not had ginger with lemon before, it's plain to me this is an excellent combination.<br /><br />If you're having trouble clearing your throat and you want to get to 100% clarity in your speaking voice, just have this one cup. It's not to be compared to other things. I highly recommend to try it once.	0	0

-1	B003R0LKTA	AD2VQ68K0LIS5	excellent ingredients but my dogs don't like it much	I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.	0	0

I received IMITATION Lemon Extract.  The two are not the same.

The last cans I bought are ""different""... different can, and it tastes more tangy, with a vinegar taste, reminds me of ketchup.

I guess I need to try it just in water and see if I can tolerate it that way.  It's probably a great product/supplement but I'm having trouble getting past the taste.  Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety."	2	1

1	B004JRKEH4	AO1Z0TQWCRGL4	Taste is great but Nutrition Facts prove hazzardous	I like Taco Bell. That may explain why I really like the taste of this Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce. It is good right from the bottle, two drips per chip, as a corn chip dip. Make nachos with a plate of chips, ladled with ground beef and onion mix, then pour on the Chipotle Sauce. What an appetizer; but unfortunately at the same calorie, fat, sodium, levels as most fancy restaurant dishes, or those huge multi-meat bacon cheese burgers. So for those who do not have to count calories or healthy nutrition, it's tasty. Spicy and flavorful without being HOT, at least to my liking, as I enjoy a bit of heat.<br /><br />If you're not a Mexican fast-food fan, you might find this product a bit unsophisticated. In that case, if the supreme high-priced Tex-Mex restaurants are your cup of tea, then skip this product. But if you want to spice up the celery, carrots and green peppers on your ball game night snack food tray, this may be as good as Taco Bell delivering to your door.<br /><br />Good also as a high calorie taco salad dressing. Unfortunately, I can't tell you if it is good on a taco because I ran the bottle dry before I got to trying it on a real taco.<br />If only they could reproduce the taste with heart healthy nutrition levels.<br />Oh well, I'll bet it's good on a cheeseburger.	0	0
-1	B00823T1K2	APP8XWYYV4PAA	Picky cat liked the first time but then will not want to eat it now	Everyone's cat has its own finickiness. Our female cat, Sammy, is the pickiest eater. She has to have a rotation of different wet foods or else she just stands there and demands more... Anyway, she loved this item the first time that she ate it. However, on the second time, she was not really interested and remains uninterested. Not sure why. I am sure that the ingredients and nutrients are better, but she won't touch this food. It is a good quality product and my dogs like the similar type of food from Nature's Variety.	0	0
-1	B000K9CDV0	ATTLUK81FJVJ3	Shipper not reliable	I purchased this tea on the advice of Dr. Oz.  It, when combined with white tea, is supposed to increase the body's metabolism and help in weight loss.  I had reached a plateau after losing 65 pounds on Weight Watchers.  After drinking this mixture for one week, I had lost another four pounds.  I keep drinking it, and the weight continuing to drop.  As of today, 72 pounds gone.  I purchased my first shipment from Amazon.com.  It arrived almost a week after the promised delivery date.  I ordered another shipment to arrive well before the initial supply ran out.  I kept contacting the shipper and was promised delivery.  I found it elsewhere on line and cancelled my order, only to be told at that point that they were sold out of this tea.  Too bad.  It's the only time I have had a problem with shipping at Amazon.com.	1	2

Also I have never been much of a fan of white chocolate but let me tell you, it's one of the most scrumptious desserts I've ever had. I've eaten almost an  entire box in a sitting (don't judge.

Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.

-1	B006GA666U	A679RXSZLNBAW	Tried to like it...	Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.	3	4
1	B003EMW3TW	A31A2XCD7XZS02	Beyond addictive	Baby Lucas Chamoy is a granulated-type candy that is pleasingly crunchy and airy, with an amazing chamoy flavor. There is a small bit of a picante-kick, but the overriding flavor is the floral chamoy. One bottle lasts quite a while, and I have become quite enamored with putting this product on top of orange sherbert and fresh mangoes!<br /><br />You can eat it right out of the bottle (poured onto the tongue), or it can be used as a food enhancer (sprinkled on something else). Great flavor, great buy, and beware of giving these out to friend as they will keep asking you for them!	1	0
-1	B0033TYF2E	A2240J73FTPR21	small bar for a high price with an untrue claim and hidden fructose	"As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain ""nothing cooked, nothing processed,"" but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains ""agave nectar"" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a ""healthy alternative"" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this ""raw"" bar, and second, they used ""agave nectar"" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used ""agave nectar"" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.<br /><br />You can research for yourself, google ""agave nectar bad""<br /><br />and look for entries from ""foodrenegade,"" ""nourishedkitchen"" and ""living-foods""<br /><br />You can also google ""fructose bad""<br /><br />check out the hits from ""about"" and ""the american journal of clinical nutrition""<br /><br />Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you're in, ""agave nectar"" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims ""nothing cooked and nothing processed"" is nothing short of fraud."	63	19

-1	B005BPVB84	A2B0ZT6CQL0EM6	It's cheaper than a candy bar, but not as tasty	On sale for just over $.50 a bar, and low expectations of a baked product, they really are not that bad.  They are almost dry and taste a little like saw-dust paste but I was not expecting milk chocolate, melt in your mouth, gooey either.  They are in between a traditional granola bar with honey binding the ingredients and dry oatmeal pressed together.  The flavors are so subtle that I had to read the wrapper a few times to remind me what flavor they were supposed to be. I checked the date of the bars which were 8 months out so they were not close to expiration and will be gone in a few weeks. Are they worth a buck a bar? Absolutely not. Will you want to eat two at once? Probably not.  Will I buy them again? No.  They were worth a try though.	0	0
-1	B000LKVSDM	A2X1TQ11DHOX5W	The paste has ruined every single dish I've made with it!	This curry paste is horrible. The green, red, whatever color, it doesn't matter. They are all bad. Totally flavorless and bland, and when you open the jar, it seems as if it hasn't even been sealed correctly and is old. I was confused for months now, thinking that all these good recipes were crap, and almost threw out my Thai cookbook. Finally after trying some other highly rated online recipes only to find the same problem, I narrowed it down to this jar of crap! Don't buy it. Save your money and your time and look elsewhere for good curry paste....	1	0
-1	B000Y434HI	A113UIDZQ471KG	I thought odor free wouldn't make a difference	I would only get this product if you really can't stand to smell them. regular bully sticks really only smell if you're smelling them or up close, like flowers. In order to make these odor free, they're covered with a plastic like coating and are not natural looking being all them same exactly size. My older pitt bull would not touch them even though bully sticks are her favorite. Luckily my puppy is teething and likes chewing just about anything so they didnt go to waste. After these were gone, I ordered a package of regular smelly sticks and both dogs are plowing through them. Dogs like stinky things!	0	0

-1	B0041CIR62	APPCJX62WKIIP	Dreadful Product that Ruined a Previously Flawless Recipe	We tried this product with a favorite family recipe.  I followed the instructions for preparing the vermicelli (soak in room temperature water) before tossing it in with the various ingredients which were not very different from the two recipes on the back of the package.<br /><br />The end result was dreadful.  So bad that one person couldn't even swallow because the texture of the noodles was off-putting.  This is a recipe we've used with different types of pasta--everything from rice noodles, egg noodles, whole wheat, low carb.  This is the first and only time we hated the end result.<br /><br />Hugely disappointing there are two good things I can say about the product:<br /><br />1) The packaging opens very easily<br />2) You get a lot of vermicelli from what seems to be a small package<br /><br />Of course, what's the point of having a lot of something you don't want to eat?  And if I'd known how really bad the end result would turn out to be, I'd probably have left it in the package, no matter how easy it was for me to open.	0	0
1	B0041NYV8E	AQ2UN38CMK119	I liked it, but tastes vary	Before sampling this, I had the advantage of reading other reviews, and I knew that this could be strong. I only had one packet, and the instructions told me to mix the contents with 250 ml of water. That's about 8 1/2 ounces, so I decided to try to divide the packet into two portions. I mixed half with 4 ounces and the other half with 6 ounces. I figured one would be slightly stronger and the other slightly less strong.<br /><br />The reviews were right. The ginger taste prevails and is quite strong. Fortunately, I like ginger. I'm a big fan of ginger beer, for example (when I can find it). There is a hint of lemon, but it is nearly lost amid all the ginger flavor. I squeezed a bit of lemon into the more dilute version, and I think I got it about perfect.<br /><br />Recommended for ginger fans.	0	0

Shredded cheese, jalapeno slices... whatever you like.<br /><br />The price is great on Amazon too, and with free shipping, I'm so happy to have found it here.

-1	B001EO5QIW	A35Q0RBM3YNQNF	Marzipan Tastes Bland and Contains Sorbitol	Normally I buy almond paste, not prepared marzipan, but thought that just this once I could save a little time. There is no one to blame but myself for not reading the ingedient list before buying. This is what happens when you rush. By now I should know that when it comes to even old stand-by products, nothing can be taken for granted.<br /><br />The ingredient list begins as expected, sugar, blanched almonds, water but then it veers off into new frontier - sorbitol -- then corn syrup and potassium sorbate finish the list. Potassium sorbate is used as a preservative to extend shelf-life, and perhaps is necessary, but why is sorbitol added to something as straightforward as marzipan? If this wasn't enough, the marzipan does not have a good almond flavor -- it is incredibly bland.<br /><br />Ironically, and a bit off the subject, I just read a book about dental health that discussed how damaging sorbitol is to the teeth and gums even though it is a popular sweetener in sugar-free gums and mints. The dentist who wrote the book stated that the bad bacteria in the mouth actually adapt to sorbitol quickly and begins to feed on it with greater frenzy than pure sugar.<br /><br />Whether the dental issue is of concern, sorbitol is widely known to cause intestinal distress in some people, and people with irritable bowel syndrome limit or completely avoid the product. Bottom line is that sorbitol isn't usually found in marzipan and unless this ingredient is specifically desired by the purchaser, I'd steer clear for that reason alone.<br /><br />I cook and bake in order to avoid additives, so this marzipan is particularly unacceptable for my use. Tallying up the plusses and minuses we have on the plus side, it is the correct texture for shaping and rolling out. On the minus side -- it is incredibly bland and is chemically enhanced with an artificial sweetener. Never again.	9	0
-1	B000GG5IXW	A3PI6O5RQF35OA	Not my cup of tea	Because this got such good reviews, I decided to try it as a substitute for my favorite Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, which has disappeared from my local grocery store. This is some of the worst chai I've ever tasted. It had a very strong artificial vanilla flavor, and none of the after bite that good black teas should have. It was so bad that I could not force myself to finish the box. I do like their classic Constant Comment, but I cannot recommend this Vanilla Chai.	1	0
1	B0051TPWUI	A1MV52KBC9HK75	Ideal Healthy Snack	The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount.	0	0

1	B001688BE2	A8WRN6S6XGAG9	Delicious Way of Making Popcorn	I sipped Chardonnay one Saturday as a lone Jiffy Pop package laid relaxed on my counter, waiting for heat. As the evening gave way to night, and the wine found its better home, I found in my moonlit kitchen that I was its suitor. I had fire.<br /><br />Like Chopin finding music, I discovered inspiration that brightened and enlightened my heart. Thoughts of hot corn, popped into a new shape, tickling my tongue, excited me into a rush. Heating the aluminum, shaking it from many angles, I danced, my smile shining up from the polyurethane floor.<br /><br />For a minute, maybe two, nothing, until the first kernel said hello, rebirthing from harsh and hard to kind and soft.<br /><br />The foil rustled softly like a fresh-pressed cotton sundress, as popping corn made its plea of escape.

-1	B0085MLY5A	A2N11YPX95JSST	Not too tasty	This coconut water isn't very tasty.  It says tropical fruit but it only tastes like guava.  There's no taste of any of the other fruit. This was my first time trying coconut water.  I know people who rave about it and I thought I could do several things with tropical fruit, but it's pretty much been a waste of money.  Only buy if you reeeally like the taste of guava.	3	1
-1	B0046IDCA2	A2WPAPA1IJOAI0	Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food	"My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally ""stew,"" with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer."	6	2

Not really, but...no noticeable difference between this and any other shampoo in terms of impact - less dryness for sure, lathers well and has a not-so-overpowering fragrance.  Ingredients list mention more ""natural"" components than most others but is not an organic shampoo - perhaps, this price point is meant to reflect ""not organic, but not a chemical soup"" segment.  Overall, slightly over-priced for its value. No real differentiation with any of the other products to warrant a premium."	0	0
1	B001EPPCFS	A2GYNFIVBHBKXT	Great biscuit, poor packing	The biscuits are delicious as expected. I was surprised by how poorly amazon packed the 6 packages of McVities in the box- they were just thrown in with 1 or 2 plastic air bubbles on top. The ends of each roll of biscuits are a bit bashed so some of the cookies are totally crumbled, but most are intact. Just don't expect careful packing and you won't be disappointed.	0	0

Then, they smelled worse than any other dog treats I have ever given my dogs but since its dog food and not human food, I still gave some treats to my dogs which resulted in a couple of days of the worst diarrhea and gas they have ever had.

1	B007ZENY5W	AQZ9FQYW60HJ4	Fantastic!	My son made this.  He didn't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all--I feared for the worse.  Determined to be polite, I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread.  It was amazing.  Apparently it rises during the baking or something.<br /><br />Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.<br /><br />We've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; I'm sure that will be delicious as well.	1	0

-1	B000EUKIRG	A3EKC0CWQQRXPJ	OK but I think there has to be something better...	I've made 2 pizzas out of this brand and maybe gluten free doughs are all like this (I'm new at this) but the dough was REALLY runny so I had to improvise and add other GF flours to it.  It was REALLY had to get the shaped dough onto the pizza stone! But once it was cooked up with the toppings and sauce, it wasn't that bad hot / warm but was horrid cold.<br /><br />If the other brands are worse tasting, I could go back to this but I'm hoping that there is something better...I like a chewy pizza crust...<br /><br />I'll update my findings as I experiment more.	4	1
1	B003LPSIUU	A5WYYC7KBSXLQ	Fresh Step VS Tidy Cat... Fresh Step Wins!!	I was so disappointed with Tidy Cat scoopable litter that I was about to go back to the regular litter, but decided to give it one more go with a different brand.  The trouble with Tidy Cat is that the soiled litter would turn to a thick, sticky mud that was very difficult to scoop and would leave a lot of mud-like residue behind.  I would end up emptying the entire litter box, clean it out, and start from scratch which defeated the purpose of scoopable litter.<br /><br />Fresh Step proved to be a major improvement.  It is so much easier to scoop and doesn't turn into the sticky mud that Tidy Cat would form.  I can actually scoop now and not have to empty the entire litter box.<br /><br />Both Fresh Step and Tidy Cat controlled odor.  Tidy Cat's plastic container was a bit easier to transport.  Fresh Step prevents litter waste; thus, saves money as pound for pound it scooped better and last longer.  Fresh Step wins hands down as it is by far the most scoopable litter.	0	0

I didn't know how good caramel can be and believe me this is truly amazing stuff.  My wife loves the traditional method of pouring it on ice cream while I like to mix it into shakes.

I probably won't buy them again because  I have  tried Pop Chips and they are more flavorful,although more expensive. They(smart fries) are a filling snack in the evening without the guilt. Other flavors might be ok....cheddar cheese seem like they might be interesting. Again, not up to Pop Chip quality in my opinion.	0	2

1	B0018KR8V0	A3OFS9BUH41GAW	Yummy!	These bars are great to have around for when you're running late and need something filling for breakfast.  They are also great to have in your purse or at work when you're surrounded by non-paleo options.  Our family likes these because they are sweet without being overpowering and filling.  The Cashew Cookie, Blueberry and Lemon bars are our favorite!  We can order them by the case through Amazon, and have them shipped to our door way cheaper than we can buy them in our grocery store.

-1	B001KS8TKY	AOVSTL0BYSZVJ	Nonni's Chocolate Biscotti	Actually, I love Nonni's chocolate biscotti and would buy them at my local grocer if they had them.  I found these listed at Amazon and ordered two containers.  When they arrived which was during the warmest part of the summer, most of the chocolate frosting had melted and flowed onto the plastic packaging which made eating them very messy.  The worst part which didn't seem to be caused by the heat was that virtually every one of the biscotti's were broken into multiple parts which I attribute to rough handling. I don't know whether this rough handling occurred at Amazon or by the shipper.  I have always liked to buy from Amazon but won't buy any more biscotti.	1	1
1	B001LG945O	A1RF9YK4BK5TRH	Pretty Good...	I enjoyed the taste... It is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip.  But unlike orange soda, this is healthier and no added sugars.  Even though this product tastes like orange soda I think it would do well for breakfast.  It may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for businesses that worry about short shelf life.  On the downside, the price is a little high for such a small can when buying 24.	0	0
-1	B000NGP8TY	A2LM20PDQ4WG9H	Bait and switch!	Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.	6	5

-1	B000ET4SM8	A3LEL6D19TUPCQ	Good but disappointed	First of all let me say the beans came quickly, were packed adequately and were priced right.  They looked and smelled fine, not too dry and decent amount of aroma.  They probably would have been fine for cooking, but they did not perform up to my expectations. I have been making Vanilla extract for the last 5+ years or so and that's why I bought the beans.  I make 750mL at a time using vodka as the base. I cut up 4 beans and began soaking them a week before Christmas.  After 2 weeks the extract was not strengthening correctly (too light of a color) so I added 2 more beans.  Now that it is the end of January (over a month of soaking) they still have not extracted properly. I have the last batch to compare it to (different beans -- I believe Tahitian) and the current batch is half the shade and strength of the previous with 50% more beans.  So I will go back to the more expensive Tahitian beans.	9	5

It's nice that they're vegan, kosher and have lots of fiber, but the sad, sad thing is, I just don't like them and can't imagine myself eating them. If I had to eat them, I would. You know, if I was little and my mother made me, like parents used to make their kids swallow cod liver oil all those years ago. Well, these bars aren't that bad, but they don't taste very good, to me anyway. I see others have liked them and I suppose taste is subjective, so please take this review with a grain of salt.	0	0
-1	B000VK339Y	A1U03XI7AVUH57	Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice	I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!	2	0

-1	B008BY7NSE	A2UVUH2M9N8URD	Not bad...	I am a passionate peanut butter lover, but as peanut butter is so high in calories, PB2 appealed to me. I actually haven't tried mixing it with water as per the directions, but I don't think I would enjoy it on its own or on toast, just as it isn't sweet enough (sorry, I need that bit of added sugar!). HOWEVER, I'm big on adding peanut butter to cottage cheese, and 2 tbsp of this PB2 powder to 1/2 cup cottage cheese is lovely! It's also quite nice mixed in with vanilla frozen yogurt (1 tbsp to 1/2 cup). I'd probably purchase again just for those uses alone, saving me 150 calories!	0	0

-1	B004T80BYE	ALDV8DDZWWPYE	Too much work for too little flavor	As you will see from the extensive reviews, you need to soften this product before you can even use it. It's currently 70 degrees in my kitchen and it's solid as a rock. Then you need to blend it back together.<br /><br />It's bland. The container suggests that you can use it as a substitute for cream cheese, but I'm not sure why you'd want to bother. I can't see putting this on a bagel---too bland---and it's just sweet enough that you wouldn't use it in savory dishes.<br /><br />Let's say you *did* want to put it on a bagel. You'd need to factor in the softening time. Maybe this product is good for folks with time on their hands, but it's just not working for me.	1	0

I put a thermometer inside to monitor those low temperatures... So far so good and I'm glad I don't need another device in the kitchen.<br /><br />Note that you need to start incubating at 75 degrees and then slowly raise the temp to 105, 110. Don't go much higher.. food enzymes start to die at around 116 degrees.<br /><br />PS<br />The only reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because the package did not give decent instructions for people working without the Yogourmet yogurt maker, and I wasted a batch by not cooling to 75 degrees. : )	5	2

-1	B000VK8HJ0	A1ZGNS0OCHONBM	The cat, the dog, nor the grackles would touch it	I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.	5	4

1	B0000D958O	A2YDJARD9Y9R2J	Folks, this is diet - keep that in mind	"Before you read my entire review, keep the following in mind: A quick internet search will show you how many calories and carbs are in a normal Pina Colada.. my search results showed me that it's typically a 500+ calorie drink.  Baja Bob gives you a 30 calorie substitute.  Let's remember this 470 calorie difference between the drinks while reading the reviews.  To put things in perspective, it would take only 7 normal pina coladas to gain a pound of fat, but to gain a pound with the Baja Bob version, you'd have to drink more than 116!<br /><br />Now that my disclaimer is out of the way, let's talk about the flavor. If you follow the directions and mix with ice in a blender, not only is the taste pleasant, but the beverage is surprisingly creamy.  This is a very sweet mixer and not something that I would like to drink every day, but it would make a great party drink.  A wonderful way to show that you're an accommodating  host to your diabetic or low-carbing guests.  I would have at least one other Baja Bob's mix on hand that doesn't require a blender too, such as margarita mix.<br /><br />Overall Baja Bob makes decent substitutes for full-calorie drinks.  No it is not nearly as good as a ""real"" pina colada, but most diet soda drinkers are already used to the differences between their diet and regular drinks.  I have managed to lose 10 lbs in the past month on my low carb diet without giving up drinks.  A close friend of mine lost about 30 over several months and had a drink every now and again, within reason of course, but Baja Bob did not throw her off her diet.  I can't say the same about a normal pina colada."	2	0

-1	B004URWG9C	A2MPNGP63XMNY0	Avoid this one	This does have a slight curry flavor, but some other awful flavor overpowers the sauce. To make it tolerable, I had to add peanut butter, sugar, and chipotle pepper. And even then, it wasn't great. It's not very spicy either (coming from someone who likes very spicy food). I will not buy this again, and it was so bad, I won't be buying any of the other curry sauces Kikkoman offers.	0	0

-1	B005EF0HTK	A35ZMLELO5TYY7	Looks good, mediocre to decent value	"This was an accidental purchase, but fun to get. This gift basket was visually appealing! When my hubby and I opened the box from Amazon (well packed!) We saw a brown bow and big bold square sticker proclaiming ""iG4U"" in brown on a red background. We tore off the cellophane right away to find many little white and brown boxes layered one after the another, pretty much the way the photo depicts. Each little box has (only) a few bites of goodies. The middle-sized boxes had a little more, of course. Everything tasted all right, and fresh enough, too. There were truffles, caramels, ginger snaps, and Newman's Own black tea, plus a funny addition of italian herb dip without crackers!The straw stuff was a natural looking material, to my liking, and the basket was unfinished and somewhat lightweight/flimsy but usable with cute brown leatherette handles on the sides. I'd classify this basket as a mediocre/decent value at $16.00, and suitable for casual or supplemental gifting to someone who likes brown and white. Hope this review is helpful, and Happy Gifting!"	0	0

-1	B0061IUIDY	A1XR58IRKP3HEZ	A little weak for my taste	I was excited to receive this product for review through Amazon.com's Vine program.  In the afternoon I prefer a good cup of tea over coffee.  And I prefer loose tea over a convenient tea bag.<br /><br />For the purpose of reviewing the tea I decided to leave the bag intact and brew it as directed.  The scent was inviting but not as potent as when I brew loose tea, so I decided to skip the Half & Half and taste it pure first.  Hmm, not bad, but not great either.  I added a little sugar and tried again.  It seemed to bring out the flavor a bit more but still, so I tried it with a splash of Half & Half.  That washed out the flavor significantly.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good tea for those who are used to a lighter flavor, but I prefer bold taste and am still hunting for the Wow factor I remember from a loose tea that came from Russia I was in love with when I still lived in Germany.  This one didn't even come close, although it does brew a nice cup of tea.  It's just a bit too bland for me.	0	0

1	B0017L3NBE	A1LJ25G1KMGENR	Delicious!	I purchased 144 (2 lots of 72) for my husband who was previously buying another brand at 2 for $1.  They were delivered in time for Christmas which was great because his crew had purchased an Amazon gift card as his Christmas present.  I've had no trouble with open packages and the seeds are delicious.  Meaty and not too salty, we enjoy them as part of a healthy diet (yes, I sneak them out of his stash.)  We eat less flour and sugar and more vegetables, protein, beans and nuts.  We spend a lot less money and feel a lot better.  What's not to like?	2	0
-1	B000EVQWHU	A3I03LP9TXRND0	Not sour	Not sour as some of the other reviewers have stated. I for one could not really taste any sour bits, but it's a fine gummi candy on it's own. Sugar coated, etc. Just wish it was sour, or at least Hairbo made a 'proper' sour gummi candy.	3	0
1	B0017ODRTO	A2FQUS8JSPL4BO	great	I love this salt. I even bought a 2 lb bag so now i fill this little shaker with more whenever i need. I also put on a screw cap from another spice container that has a pop top with holes. So now it has two sets of holes for the salt to go through so it slows down the pour rate some. Otherwise, I would always forget and put too much salt in the food. Plus this salt is more saltier, so you can use a little less.	1	0
-1	B000B1X14K	A3T3OCP2OEVJC4	Not very lemon-y	This oil tastes like regular olive oil, with maybe a hint of lemon. I have had very good lemon olive oils, and this doesn't come close.  It doesn't taste bad - just not lemon-y. But I guess I can't expect too much for the price. Usually a good lemon oil will be at least twice the cost.	0	1

Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!	3	0
-1	B001AJ1ULS	A2494Q44JVT14Y	Zero stars- my dog became ill after eating these	My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.	1	0

I have found two other reviewers that also found Patak's Madras Curry Paste too sour, so perhaps that's a Patak quirk.  Even my husband, who normally likes sour tastes and likes to squeeze lemon juice into nearly everything he eats, finds the results too sour.	0	0

-1	B001RVFEP2	A13ML5W7NK1M7O	LOVE these with one caveat	"I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, ""sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil."" Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil."	1	1
1	B001SJR4XS	A13TX487EQNKK7	Delicious Coffee	I ordered this coffee based on all the positive reviews.  I was looking for a robust roast that would work well in a French press, which I started using about a year ago.  I have tried many different sourced beans and blends and grind them coarse in a burr grinder.  I have a few favorites, but I can't always travel to the stores that carry them.  Finding this particular coffee on Amazon was great!  It is the robust but smooth brew I was looking for.  That it is shade grown and fair trade is a major plus, as I will always search those out as a responsible consumer.  I will be ordering this again and again.	1	0
-1	B0051COPH6	A1TYL7W9P69DU5	Smelled and Tasted Good	Well, let me start by saying this product smelled pretty good (and that says a lot for baby food as it usually makes me want to wrinkle my nose and say ick!). My baby girl seemed to enjoy the taste and ate a good half of the pouch in one sitting.  I even took a little lick myself and it was surprisingly tasty.  I wasn't thrilled about the opening being on a slant.  My baby enjoys holding these pouches herself to suck out the food and she had a difficult time gripping it properly while getting her mouth around the opening.	0	1

1	B005K4Q37A	A39VEK71BJ7HLL	Really deserves each star!	My favorite thing about this K-cup Cappuccino is that it does NOT taste artificial!!!!  I purchased a personalized variety pack of K-cups on amazon and this cup was included.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the artificial flavoring of many K-cups.  This tastes smooth, creamy, and sweet (bc of the caramel).  It tastes like it could have come straight from the coffee shop, really!<br /><br />You don't have to add any cream or anything because it is already included in the cup.  The only complaint that I can imagine others might have is its level of sweetness, if they don't like sweet cappuccinos, but then don't purchase one that is caramel flavored right?	1	2
1	B004IREFUM	A363CL7Z8R9F1G	Folgers Gourmet Selection KCup Vanilla Biscotti	I bought these for my dad, he received a Keurig Coffee Maker for a gift and was astonished at the price of the K-cups.  After trying several different brands, he couldn't find a flavor that matched the Folgers Vanilla Biscotti he used to get for his one cup coffee maker.  I first found them at an ok price for 12 cups, but found I saved $12 by buying here.  He says the flavor is great.	0	0

-1	B004OQ257C	A3KZ7OH4VRL048	Two different takes	My mother is a diabetic, so she uses Splenda all the time. I myself don't use Splenda that often by myself, but when Mom comes over and we make a batch of iced tea, I'll find myself drinking it. Between the two of us, we came up with two totally different opinions of this new Splenda with Antioxidants.<br /><br />I hardly noticed a difference from the regular Splenda. Except for it taking a little more stirring to desolve, I found it almost identical. That in and of itself is not a bad thing, but if you compare the prices - currently $17 for 320 packs of this and $19 for 700 packs of regular Splenda - I have a hard time justifying buying this rather than sticking to regular Splenda and using the money you saved to buy a supplement. I guess if you would forget to take the supplement, this could be a good compromise.<br /><br />Mom, however, hated the stuff. She could not get it to dissolve in her (cold) iced tea, and in fact most of the Splenda stayed on top of the ice rather than falling to the bottom. She also noticed a slight difference in taste. Finally, she had issues with the packages, which are actually foiled on the inside, which make them harder to open than the regular packs. Anyone with arthritic or particularly thick fingers may have issues here.<br /><br />All in all, while not a BAD product, I can't really recommend this to anyone. No matter how you slice it, there's a better option out there.	1	0
-1	B000EM6PG2	A1ND6709V0IDJ0	Tastes good, contains glue	I have been drinking this tea daily for years, and plan to continue. The orange and other flavors nicely mask the plain green-tea flavor, which otherwise tastes like river-water.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the strings are glued to the tea bags. Yes, I know that's hard to believe - the glue melts almost immediately upon contact with the hot water. You might be able to dunk the tea bag four or five times before it falls off, splashing hot tea onto the tablecloth.<br /><br />One can imagine the glee with which the Lipton executives toss actual pennies into the air, as they watch the laid-off staple plant workers shuffle off. One thing they are certainly not doing is drinking this tea.<br /><br />The packaging does not indicate what animal the glue is from, nor its nutritional value. Horses, cattle?	2	2

-1	B00264TMWU	A2JZWGDOXDM1OT	BEWARE!!  Made my dog Sick!!!	"I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my  5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named ""Calla"".  Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night.  We thought it might be a back issue and our ""Three"" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease.  We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a ""little"" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled ""Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods"" and started to really connect the dots.  Yesterday she was diagnosed with ""Pancreatitis"" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment.  I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this.  She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes.  Please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy. I wish I could give a product -minus 5 stars!!!!"	4	4

-1	B000FDDETG	A2SZWMS0CRJ0T2	Unpleasantly Dense	I love rye bread, and grew up smelling and tasting fresh loaves of it in the New York City area.  I've been trying all the Hodgson Mill's breads and looked forward to this one.  So far I have baked three loaves of the rye mix, and it comes out looking very little like the photo on the box.<br /><br />Although the smell is somewhat pleasant (a fairly mild rye smell actually), the loaf does not seem to form the many tiny air pockets depicted or expected.  Thus it is incredibly dense, which makes for easy slicing, but a not-terribly-nice mouth-feel on those deli-meat sandwiches I remember from my youth.  The Publix supermarket-baked rye and rye-pumpernickel is actually much closer, from a texture point of view.<br /><br />Perhaps it is my bread machine, a slightly older Panasonic BT55P.  I am using the recommended whole-wheat cycle, which takes five hours, and have followed the bread mix instructions exactly.  I've tried using all butter, all oil (canola) and a combination of the two: same result.  I don't think I would buy this flavor again.  Stick to the white and honey wheat: both are fabulous.	3	4

Will definitely keep this on subscription, as the price cannot be beat anywhere near me.  Even mediocre coffee costs $7 or more per bag in the stores.	0	0

1	B000E7WM0K	A2GBFT3IGK7862	More than just a taste of Thai	"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).<br /><br />While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.<br /><br />While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat."	0	0
-1	B00271OPVU	A19RGDJPNZ7NZ	Great stuff at first, but not for long (see my edit within review)	"I liked the flavor of this syrup at first, as did my wife.  It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the ""store-bought"" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?""<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking."	9	22

1	B000AXWVQS	A2K1AVZEXFYADT	Delicious, as always	I love, and will always love, Lizano salsa!<br /><br />My sole reason for only four out of five stars is that the bottle is very small.

1	B003CK7O36	A2P1O2B865EBI3	Best chai you can ever get from a bag.	"I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional ""chai"", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended."	11	1
-1	B0000T6ZY6	AIGX1J3H3F0UW	not the right thing?	I ordered this for a friend and she told me what she got but it is the wrong thing. Not only is everything in the basket wrong it is not even half as much as it should of had, and everything is in flavors she does not like. I hope this can be fixed because it is not what I paid for.	2	0

-1	B001SAXPEO	AKGQ6RM68SQY1	ONLY awful because SOMETIMES they are awful	and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.	2	1
-1	B0017I1Q9I	A1D4OQTA7UO5A3	Not the best	I tried the red salsa and was disappointed.  This is just like any other mass produced salsa, made cheap, tastes cheap.<br /><br />The best I've tried is Border Town Salsa. [&#8230;]<br /><br />That is real salsa that tastes like it comes from your favorite restaurant.<br /><br />Try some of that if you want something to impress your friends and family.	0	2
1	B0039ZOZ86	A2YYUOXGL9JGZT	One of my favorite flavors!	I tried this flavor when it was part of the variety pack I ordered. I liked them so well - I ordered a whole box of just these!

-1	B002B8XLAK	A26N3GLFUNS4NL	I was CHEATED....!!!!!!	BEWARE the changing descriptions here in Amazon folks...when I first viewed this item, admittedly a convenient item to have in the pantry for a snowy day, the descriptions was for THIRTY-TWO (32) 1 quart (32-oz) cartons for around $33...NOT 12 cartons as the description NOW reads. I thought a dollar per carton was a pretty good price, but I NEVER would have ordered it at almost 3 dollars a carton...that's highway robbery.<br /><br />I am going to complain to Amazon, don't expect to get any satisfaction, but will try anyway.<br /><br />So be careful: anytime something here in Amazon sounds too good to be true it probably is.	0	2
-1	B0069AFIN4	A1BIKJYYZ1RZBF	Good coffee!	I enjoyed this coffe quite a bit but I can not say I enjoyed it any more than any other good quality K-cup coffees available at a much lower price. Doesn't seem to taste the same as in-store brewed.	3	0
1	B0089SPDUW	A2M98NPVGQX2GK	Coffee is good; name is good....	The name of this coffee is Mahogany, in my mind a deep rich brown. The coffee flavor is deep and rich, and the color is dark brown. It is delicious.	0	0
1	B007I7Z3Z0	A3LXXYBYUHZWS5	Great flavor with no aftertaste.	Almost every add-in powder or liquid flavoring that I've tried has had a pretty bad aftertaste. With this Lipton To Go Stix I didn't experience an aftertaste at all. The honey, mango and pineapple flavors were all very subtle but mixed well together. I highly recommend this product for anyone who enjoys flavored tea.	0	2
-1	B0049RDI0Y	AD9346FOB4ZB8	best coconut water	I taste tested this with vita coco and c2o came out superior with a blind test.  vita coco leaves a sour aftertaste while c2o is somehow just sweet enough to drink without feeling like crap.  I purchased 3 cases already and i tried it at first because joe rogan said its effing delicious. i drank up to 3 a day.  I'm about to order another case but i guess they recently changed the price.  before it was $24 with free shipping, now theres no free shipping and price increased to $29.  so with shipping its about $38 for 12.  unfortunately i am not rich enough to afford this so until the price gets realistic (cmon $3 a can) then i wont purchase any.  what a shame, this is the reason for my 3 stars, if it was more affordable then it would be 5	18	5
-1	B0019CSQ36	A635EJI324B01	Jerky-esque.....	"I can only call this stuff ""jerky-esque,"" because it is really not like any ""real"" jerky that I've ever had before. Easy to bite through and chew, but extremely processed and pressed into form. As alluded to in another review, the look and texture of the these is very reminiscent of jerky-treats that are made for dogs. Overall, I'd give the texture 2.5-3 stars....different...a bit odd...ok, but not really ""meaty.""<br /><br />Taste, I'd give 2 stars. They rate as edible, but certainly not good. Eating a full serving at one time tends to feel like a chore, so that should tell you right there that these things aren't too great. Not horrible, but not something I'd prefer to eat...<br /><br />Value. Decent, but in a subjective sense. You get a lot of product for the price....which is great if you happen to like them....but nothing to crow about if you don't...."	0	0

-1	B000HJ7AIY	A1ZDBBP8PUWZ3D	Ineffective	Want to add my voice to the negative reviews here. My family brought home some moths in store-brand brown rice and have been battling a minor infestation ever since. Minor in that we've kept them down to only one or two living moths visible at any given time; less minor in that the larvae get into /everything/ before we find them.<br />Before Safer, I had used another brand, which was reasonably effective, catching several moths in a two-week period. When I returned to the hardware store for another box, they were all out, but had LOTS of Safer brand traps. Now I know why.<br />The sticky patches are small and not very sticky. I'd take the trap down and see black smudges on the stickum that said a moth had landed on it and then flown away again. In a couple of weeks it had caught one moth, and there were obviously others flying around elsewhere.<br />I returned to the hardware store for another package of the first brand (I am not remembering the name) and informed the manager of the store that this worked very badly. I hope he will watch out for his business and cease to stock these money-wasters. Sadly, they seem to be the only brand stocked in most places.	3	0

-1	B007HERNSO	AZFOZTEJAI5J5	Cats are obligate carnivores	Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.	3	0
-1	B000FDCS0C	A1LGHOQI9LWVHT	yuck	I have purchased this item from the grocery store previously and really enjoyed it- I am a big fan of anchovies.

It may have just been a fluke, but I am not ordering it again.	4	0

1	B001TLY7A8	A3GCQWKU1BB2XZ	Wow!	This is the third flavor of this brand we tried and it, like the other two, have been a huge hit with our cat. We follow a primarily raw food diet for him and sometimes get cans as a treat (or if we get a little lazy). This brand is high quality and really does seem safe for human consumption. Amazon offers an amazing deal so we're back to stock up before the cost goes up. Delivery was a dream, as usual. For less than twenty cents more per can than some horrible by-product laden generic cat food, our little beast (and we) are satisfied. Marbella Paella was a huge hit!	6	0

-1	B000HJ7AIY	A37CMN4MISYDLG	small stickly area to catch moths	I've used these before and was very happy with its performance.  But with my latest purchase, I was surprised to see the sticky area covers only 50% of the trap size. This  smaller sticky catch area means you have to buy this brand more often.  I looked at my old traps and most of the trap is sticky, and covered in moths, but they are not Safer brand traps.  They work just fine, so I say Safer is not a good deal for the price.	1	0
-1	B005DN7QZG	AUUFW7PTUHLT	Decent flavor, not very sweet	"Unlike the other reviewer, I thought the flavor was okay but it lacked sweetness. I'd read about stevia not dissolving well in cold water, so I ran some warm water into an empty flavored-water bottle, added the mix, shook well, and then filled with ice cubes and cold water. The result was stronger than a flavored water, but not quite as strong as a kool-aid-type flavoring mix. The real disappointment was that I didn't taste any sweetness at all, it was just like drinking unsweetened Kool-Aid after forgetting to add sugar! I haven't tried adding something else, like maybe a different form of stevia that does taste sweet to me.<br /><br />When reading any review, remember that people ""taste"" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia (or sucralose) as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. So both the other reviewer and I are accurately reporting our experiences, and you will need to find out how any particular product tastes to *you*."	0	0
1	B000HDL1P8	A2UE4INGY71K97	Good soup.	I like this soup.  It is very close to the quality of a restaurant and easy to make.  We mix in some egg-beater and add a few mushrooms to make it perfect. Enjoy.	0	0
1	B0052HX9JA	A2RCVAHTXAH38Q	Two servings	This product is great to keep on hand for a light lunch that's quick and easy.  My husband and I both enjoy a mug of hot soup a couple of times a week, and this serves us nicely (we both tend to have lighter appetites).  It has a good consistency, is packed with tasty ingredients, and there is plenty of chicken.  One selling point is the terapack.  After learning about BHPA-containing can liners used by many soup manufacturers I decided we needed to avoid the ubiquitous stuff whenever possible.	1	0

-1	B0000VABWQ	ACLVI2R339047	Terrible customer service and shipping!	The gumballs are fine.  Not a lot you can do to a gumball.  However, the customer service and shipping process for the Candy Depot is totally inept.  First, I received an email that my orders had been cancelled.  No explanation, just cancelled.  When I emailed to inquire what was going on, I got an email back saying that the items were being shipped by a quicker service, so I could receive the gumballs in time for Christmas (to go with the gumball machine that I purchased as a gift).  Great!  Then, two days later, I get an email from Amazon stating that my gumballs had shipped on that day, the 22nd, and not on the 18th, the date the Candy Depot stated they had shipped the item.  So, on Christmas day, there will be a gumball machine, but no gumballs.  Of course, if the Candy Depot had been honest, or at least not totally incompetitent, I could have gone out locally and gotten some.  But, alas, too late.  By the way, when I got the Amazon shipment notification, I again emailed The Candy Depot to ask what was going on, forwarding to them their email stating they had shipped on the 18th and asking what was going on.  Surprise, no response.  I suggest you get your gumballs locally or from someone other than the Candy Depot, unless you don't care when you get them (a week or so).	8	0

These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm.

-1	B0044Q8RYW	A2LU1XQU394ZL3	Good Price but My Dogs Didn't Love Them	For the money, this is a good deal.  You get a big bag of X-large 'bones'.  And compared to other brands like Busy Bone where they charge you five dollars for two bones - this really is a good price!<br /><br />Oddly enough though, my dogs didn't just love them.  Now don't get me wrong, they ate them - but that's not really saying much since they eat just about anything.  But they didn't snarf them down and beg for more like they have with some other brands.  It could be because this is the first time I've given them something peanut butter flavored, or it could be the brand - unfortunately, I really can't say why they didn't like them - I can only report my observations.<br /><br />For only $9 to $12 a bag, it's certainly worth the money to give them a try...and who knows, your dogs could love them.	1	0

However, George is not terribly fond of people food, and he has only finished one of the cans that I have given him so far - the Sesame Chicken, as it turns out. He clearly likes the broth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up. Some people food is too good for cats to pass up!	2	1
1	B0016LL5DS	A85PB2BX6O8XA	"""Organic"" = Health Food, no?"	This stuff deserves any rationalization you can come up with in order to attempt guilt-free consumption.  I used to get it regularly at a local supermarket, then it disappeared without an explanation or forwarding address.  Last week happened on a few jars at the same supermarket...was told that a jobber had left a box.  So, maybe someday they will just appear again, like magic.  As I paid $2.99 per jar, doubt that I would ever spring for the Amazon price PLUS shipping.  It's truffle-like and only the nutritional label keeps me from having more than a teaspoon [ok, half tablespoon] at a time.	1	0

-1	B001BCXTGS	A3FKGKUCI3DG9U	If it looks good, is it good for the cats?	"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet."	0	0

But one thing I've never done is have espresso over ice.<br /><br />This product had sugar added (beet sugar) so it is NOT made for purists and a web search did not give me the info I wanted as to how much caffeine this product has.<br /><br />What it does have is an excellent flavor that was unexpected from a canned product and a convenience that I find gratifying.<br /><br />Take the warning on the back of the can seriously--do NOT shake this product before using, it actually isn't necessary (I shook it a little to see why there was a warning and it frothed all over the place when I opened it).<br />- if you don't have issues other than not wanting milk in your iced espresso have no fear, if there was milk in it I couldn't tell.<br /><br />Delicious, flavorful, not overly bitter -just enough to give a kick, convenient.<br /><br />I will definitely buy more of this product!

The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter - with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.<br /><br />However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.  I'm going to try and get used to it!	2	0
-1	B0016510QG	A3D81H6GXY7RXD	stick with the Keebler elves	Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.	3	3
1	B008ZRKZSM	A15S9OH2IG6VVD	Perfect.	"I've been buying this product for the last 4 years and have never waned in my love for it. Not only is it much more convenient than jarred peanut butter (MUCH easier to spread/prepare and bake with especially) but it also tastes better to me; much more ""peanut"" flavor, not too sweet but always sweet enough, and with the option of sweetening it extra if you like. Plus you can't beat the nutritional stats on this baby. I'll never go back to regular peanut butter again!"	0	0

I found slimstix after doing some research on low calorie mojitos and they tasted great!  I brought the whole box to the party and everyone was asking me if they could have one.  I tried my friend's mojito and compared it to mine and mine was actually better!  It also tastes great if you muddle blackberries and strawberries!  I'm hooked!	3	0
-1	B006BXV130	A1ZU55TM45Y2R8	Not to bad, but not my favorite	I got a box of this to try out and let me first say I eat fruit loops, apple jacks, and other similar cereals. My wife eats count chocula and some other chocolate varieties. Both of us tried this Krave cereal and according to my wife it is one of the worse tasting cereals she has ever eaten. For me it tasted a bit like cookie crisp. It was by no means the best cereal I have ever had but it is not on my list of favorites.<br /><br />I'll probably go ahead and finish the box off but I highly doubt this will make another appearance in my kitchen in the future after this box is gone.	0	0

-1	B000SATIS2	A1HGXLP6WATS4B	Sweet, floral taste but......where's the raspberry?	"A long-time summer favorite is a tall glass of raspberry iced tea.  When I saw the Raspbery Essense Tea by Davidson's and also saw it was made with black tea, not the herbal stuff, I thought I'd try it.  When the bag was opened I did not smell any raspberry at all, it was more like a very sweet flowery air freshener.  I checked the label again to make sure I had not ordered the wrong stuff, but it said Raspberry Essence.<br /><br />Ok, sometimes things do smell differently than they taste.  I added the loose tea to a tea ball and threw a couple of large family size tea bags into the sun tea jar with it, added filtered water, and waited 5 hours.  The result was a very floral tea that had no raspberry flavor that I could detect.  The tea isn't really bad, it just doesn't taste like raspberry tea.  The floral flavor is quite strong and nearly over-powers the black tea, even extra black tea added to the mix.<br /><br />I may use it a few more times for something ""different"" but it just isn't what I expected or wanted.  Maybe this winter it can be made hot with honey to take care of a scratchy throat."	1	0
-1	B003Q4TPAI	A33ZQGPSUAP17G	Very sweet, but okay if you spice it	I found this tea to be way too sweet, but I found a solution. Pop open the package, dump in a big handful of black peppercorns, wait about a day, and the next day the tea is spicy and much better. Of course, don't drink the peppercorns. It's still not my #1 fave (I'm more of a fan of Bigelow tea bags and Tazo concentrate) but the pepper makes it better.	0	0

Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner).	1	0
1	B003O7A77C	A3MTL8TQ6OUA2T	Think Big	The first time I ordered this product, I only got a small amount. This time I went big! It has a wonderful smell. Great for cooking.. adds a great flavor (the smell goes away when cooking). It smells NOTHING like coco-butter--which I hate. It really does smell like a fresh cracked coconut.<br /><br />It also feels great on the skin after shaving or exfoliating. A small bit on hair after washing keeps it smelling wonderful and shining.<br /><br />It does come frozen and is a solid at room temp. Just place it outside or on a heater vent for  a few moments to make it fluid.	2	0

I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as ""grassy""? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one."	0	3

Anyway, bought these due to glowing reviews and they are indeed delicious.  Now I eat 1 every morning with Greek yogurt.

My back and top of my arms get very very dry as soon as I get out the shower and my skin is very tight as if I just washed with straight alcohol.

1	B007I7Z3Z0	A1P8DIBAXF6H37	Tasty	When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.<br /><br />The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.<br /><br />The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.<br /><br />Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.<br /><br />This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it.	0	1

Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****	0	0
-1	B005VOONKI	A2GL934UT3XENH	Strong Branding, Weak Flavor	I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.	1	1

I generally steer clear of Oatmeal and Nuts in my Cookies (Give me a good old Chocolate Chip Cookie any day!), but these have a very nice Chocolate Chip taste, the Oatmeal taste is there, but it's not overpowering, and the Almonds didn't bother me very much. My only real complaint is in the packaging: The large box only contains 6 moderately-sized Cookies, which are individually-wrapped. The individual wrapping is good if you want to take a Cookie or two on the road with you, but when I saw the box my first thought was ""With a box that size, I'd expect more than six Cookies."""	0	1

(she goes through a 12 inch bully stick in about 20 mins.) I also wanted something that would be good for her teeth. I started w the large bone but she got down to half of it in about 15 mins. i had read that its not a good idea to feed one that's too large for your dogs size because it could fracture their teeth but i decided to try xl bone anyway (i think it says 80 ir 90+ lbs on the pckg) shes chewed on some pretty hard things before with no issues. but the XL (19.99 where i bought it) she managed to bite chunks off of so I had to take that away and trade her for a bully stick because I was concerned about her trying to swallow the large pieces. i was hoping it would be like rawhides n bullysticks and would get softer as she chewed so she could eat small pieces. but its really hard and stays that way. I'm sad it didn't work out for us because it is healthy and definitely would have been good for scraping her teeth. back to bulky sticks we go.	0	1

1	B0001WOLMU	A2LDRPRW1ALU9V	Excellent Vanilla Powder	"Husband wanted some vanilla powder to sprinkle on his morning lattes. Searched many stores and couldn't find a local supplier. Once again Amazon was a great source.<br /><br />He likes the flavor and the shaker works well. I like the size of the container (since it wasn't ordered to cook with we had no use for a large container or pound of bulk powder).<br /><br />In response to unhappy reviewer - nowhere does this product claim to be ""pure"" i.e. 100% vanilla. Two accurate descriptions mention the cane juice and the silica. Yes, cane juice is a form of sugar and therefore the source of the sweetness. Silica is a mineral commonly used as a flow agent for powders. (It is also an ingredient in many other items including glass, fiber optics, cosmetics, and supplements.) It is misleading to insinuate that silica=sand=glass.<br /><br />This is a good product and it is exactly what it claims to be, ""a vanilla powder that adds sweetness and enhances flavor.""

1	B004OLKF60	AUON7WG0LQPB4	Finally!	"My wife is a coffee snob ( she calls herself that too) and we have browsed Amazon for K cups for  a couple years, We must have purchased every dark French Roast there is. All the coffee was good but just was not ""it"" until we ordered this coffee. Finally a coffee dark, bold enough yet smooth and not bitter. She even runs it thru the machine twice and still gets a good cup of coffee. May cost a little more than others we have purchased but well worth it. Now when re-ordering I can just go to my last coffe order and re-order same. Simple, quick and satisfing. Plus it has a cool picture of the Eifle Tower on the box."	0	0

-1	B000ED7M3Q	A2CUEP5A2NQFY4	A 2 because it worked as a dusting but not as a substitute for non-gf flour in recipes.	New to the GF world as of 12/10.  Already tired of the bad taste and smell from GF flours.  Bob's Red Mill products are so easy to find that of course it was the first one I purchased and tried.  Using a mixture of this flour with some salt and pepper for dusting chicken turned out really well.  Next I tried using it in muffins and biscuits as I would have my old non-gluten free flours.  Horrible.  I have been doing a lot of research into this and find it to be products that contain fava beans or other bean flours are just not right for substituting for your old non-gf flour.  I just tried Pamela's and loved it, as close to the old way things tasted before being diagnosed.	0	0
-1	B000LKXJEI	A104M4DKQ96IT0	Worst jerky ever	Disgusting, slimy, stinky!  I love jerky but have a weak jaw and have trouble chewing it. A diet website recommended this meatless jerky, so I ordered it to try it.  Absolutely horrible!  I recently gave the entire order (except for a small bite I tasted) to a friend to be donated to feed the homeless.  I hope someone may like it.  It comes from the package wet and slimy and has a clove-like odor.  That's about all I can remember about it.	4	1

This cola is for something else; perhaps is good for mixing with alcoholic beverages, or coffee, but definitely NOT for ice-cones. The taste is very strong, so I do not recommend this for kids. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad syrup, BUT -- It is a syrup for adults to mix with ""adult"" drinks, not kids. I'm just giving it 3 stars because it doesn't specify anywhere that this product shouldn't be used to make frozen colas nor to add on icy-cones."	1	1
1	B0019415ZU	A2C9XE9I8RSKNX	THE best banana crisps	These are not the fried banana chips from the grocery store- they are fresh bananas, sliced and freeze dried, so the flavor is like a fresh banana with a nice crispy texture.  No added sugar or fat- and very good.  I will definitely be ordering these again. I never go through bananas fast enough when I buy fresh- these are the perfect solution- and would be great on cereal!!  I like them out of the bag!	0	0
1	B000084ETV	A2D7J11NURB8F7	Great food!!	I was so ecstatic when I purchased two 44lb bags of canidae dog food.  We have used this food for years and my dogs love it. They have  beautiful coats. On  August 15, 2011 for 41.99 each with free shipping from amazon. The actual shipper was Petcare RX. Since I am feeding 4 large dogs (including a rescue) we go through a lot of food. Its nice to have it delivered to your door. I just signed on to reorder and noticed that amazon increased the price from $41.99 to $55. In theory, there goes free shipping. They rolled it into the new cost of the food. Now, it is no cheaper for me to purchase it on amazon since my neighborhood pet store sells it for $54.00 and I don't have to order it 7-10 days ahead just to make sure I get it before our current supply runs out. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!	1	0

-1	B005V9UG18	A2TRWV1MSEEBUO	Sad they changed the formula	I was the biggest Orgain fan, purchasing many cases a month. They have recently changed the formula and the new taste is bad and very different.  Also, they've removed the antioxidant complex. They also added a sweetener - Stevia which I don't understand. Usually, sweeteners are added to make products taste better, not worse. I wish they'd wouldn't have messed with a great thing.	16	1
1	B0042GUK94	A37U44QN3A3DJN	Satisfying lollipop	This lollipop is not one that you can chew or break with your teeth, you have to suck on it til the very end.  So, if you're one that likes to chew on your lollipop, these are not the lollipops for you. This is the kind of lollipop where you taste the flavor and want just a little more so you just keep it in your mouth until it's gone.  Kind of like a Cheeze-it where you get a taste of cheese, not quite enough, and it leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />This might sound like a bad review but it isn't.  I like lollipops that aren't sugary tasting and have enough of the right flavor to keep me interested.  Frankly, their addictive because you get the chocolate, butterscotch (my fave), latte, etc. flavors in a long-lasting treat.<br /><br />Also, found this to be an alternative treat to sugary alternatives like processed cookes and candy that just don't taste good like they used to when I was a child.	3	0
1	B003TNANSO	A2ZYQQF0FRKE3O	High Protein, Low Carb + Delicious	I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!	1	0

-1	B004ZIER34	AF3X7J0XC391L	A bit bland but not a bad alternative	I cannot say I had high expectations for a low-acid French roast coffee.  It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full-bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee.  It is not bad an certainly an alternative if you are susceptible to acid but it is not in competition for any premium coffee awards.	1	0
1	B001FA1KJO	AC57A1QMUXK10	Save money on K cups, use these bags instead	I use these when I just want a cup of coffee. I make tea the same way. Just put the bag in my cup. Set it under the spout just as if I had put a K cup in the machine. Make sure to operate the handle after the blue light comes on. Then push the blue button you want for the size of the cup and the hot water flows into the cup, over the bag and in a copule if minutes I have a nice hot cup of coffee! I use the K cups for desert coffees. It saves money and is much faster and less wasteful than old types of coffee makers.	1	0

The only thing I ever go to Starbucks for use to be espresso, but no more. A double costs around 2 bucks, and a tip. Now these costs about 25 cents per serving, so a double is around 50 cents, and I feel its just as good. Its not that I am a tightwad and will not buy the caps from Nespresso, at around 55cents a pop, I just did not care for the taste of their product. An excellent product and a very good value.	0	0

The second cup was better.  My husband thought they were too sweet.  I will finish the box but will try the plain cider next time.  The caramel made covered up the apple taste and made them sweet.  Not bad though for only 10 calories.  I didn't need any dessert last night!	1	0

Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated"".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell."	0	0

-1	B004N5DHDU	AMWN4UGD6BQPA	Doesn't taste good, weird after-taste	I bought this last night at a local store because they are on sale. I have been longing to try the organic one for the sake of my baby's health. But this tastes so weird, almost like the cough syrup. The taste on each puff are not made evenly, I believe that is how they manufacture the puff, dry the puff out and spray the flavor & color onto each puff and package. And they dont melt as easily as the Non-organic one. I am not impressed. Would return the unopened ones to the store.	0	0

-1	B000084EK8	A1Z54EM24Y40LL	Not the favorite in our house	Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it.	2	0

-1	B005VOOM2W	A2GL934UT3XENH	Strong Branding, Weak Flavor	I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.	1	1

-1	B001SIRU42	A1FRQ3XAZAK4G3	Never again	I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.	8	6

-1	B000BZZKVS	A23ZZL3C7NCBDD	Not Yummy, Package Reacts in Mouth	"I have been cycling a few hours in the heat on weekends, and using this type supplement to get what I need while riding, so I bought a case of the Tangerine with Caffeine. I have to say they seem to do the job and give me what I need, and the boost from the caffeine works as desired. The problem I have with the product is the taste is pretty bad, like concentrated children's aspirin. Also, the container/package seems to react with the my teeth or fillings, like having a battery on your tongue. So, basically consuming these is not pleasant, and I dread having to do it (like taking medicine). So, I will stick with the main competitor in this marketplace ""Gu"", which taste great."	0	0
-1	B000G16E5S	A9WXYU5NW5M5Q	Great at first but something went wrong	"I'm a chai enthusiast, so when I first tasted this, I was excited. It's not ""authentic"" but it was milky and sweet with a kick. After the 2nd canister, however, the taste changed and it just wasn't good anymore. I don't know what happened. I had to trash the entire pack."	0	0
-1	B004MO6NI8	A1SCANWWQTEG9I	A distant runner up to Monster	Not a fan of No Fear. It has a very sweet & fruity soda flavor with an unpleasant aftertaste. It left me feeling dehydrated and cotton-mouthed instead of refreshed and energized.<br /><br />Energy drinks for me are few and far between. I will continue to stick with Monster on the occasions I pick one up though.	0	0

1	B001E5DZTS	A213OIMAP56C0M	Great item!!	Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.	0	0
-1	B003V3CWVS	A6KL17KKN0A5L	It's okay...	I was happy to see this product available for subscription. The price is very good compare to buying from Asian food grocery. Growing up in Japan, I tried MANY these instant curry sauce and these products are very popular in Japan. Compare to other products, these are okay, better than nothing. I don't know what makes me feel bad after eating this, but my guess is the fat in this product. Good thing is it's very convenient to make a quick meal with steamed rice by boiling the pouch in hot water for few minutes. There are better ones out there (try S&B Golden Curry, for example), but they are more expensive.	1	0

Purchased this product in August 2011, made our life so much easier, Steam+Blade can not beat that when preparing the baby food, and this is way better than buying off the shelf, You know You can put the best organic products for You baby. Also what a wonderful customer service they have.<br />The holders on the bottom for the blades got broken. I called in on Sunday 2/12/2012, left a message additionally send mail, Nancy got back to me on Monday next day in the morning, I explained the situation, since I have the old model - no question was asked - they send me the new machine. THAT what the Customer service should be. Excellent experience of using the product and feeling like they treat the customers like they deserve.	0	0
-1	B001BORBMY	A2YEV9NFLE379V	Dog loves it but......	After two years on Eukanuba lamb and rice i thought i would try a different food for my choc lab just to give him a bit of variety.<br />He likes the food alot not surprisingly but the difference is after three weeks of eating it is that he is alot hungrier than he was before, his poop is alot looser, he is thirstier and his breath is not good. His coat condition and enery levels are very good though so a mixed bag for me over all. I will likely go back to the previous food with the next order.	0	0

So I tracked it down at the local healthy grocery stores. This past month I cannot find this stuff anywhere! I am not sure why. So now I will be buying it off of Amazon...well why not I order everything else from Amazon. I think it is cheaper on here too. I haven't found many cereals that taste great but this one is it! Of course I am also a pumpkin lover but it isn't overly pumkin-y (okay I made that word up). Just try it!	0	0
-1	B004XY2AI4	ATBA73TF47YKQ	GOOD TASTING PRODUCT, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE	"I have purchased other gluten free granolas and been disappointed by the taste and texture.  Purely Elizabeth's granola tastes good, stays crunchy, and has interesting ingredients.  Definitely something I would purchase again as long as I didn't have to deal directly with the company.<br /><br />My intial order with the company took 2 weeks and 3 email contacts before I received the shipment.  When I opened the package I discovered that I was shorted 1 bag of granola.  I promptly called the company and left a message regarding the shortage and asked for either an email or phone call back.  No response.  The next day I emailed and explained the shortage, provided all of my contact information again and 2 days later, still no response.  Today was contact #3 regarding the shortage and still no response.<br /><br />Again, good product - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.<br /><br />addendum 3/28/12:  The company finallly responded with an email and shipped me the missing bag of granola along with an extra ""apology"" bag of another flavor."	0	0
-1	B002GWQ2TS	AVJD277LH9Y4O	Horrible	I ordered this tea based off the other two reviews which had made it seem like a pleasant green tea with cherry notes - this was not, however, the tea which I received. I'm not quite sure what ingredient used in this blend gave it such an overwhelming, almost chemical, cherry flavor but nothing about it was good. Aside from being able to see that there were other ingredients in this blend, I would've assumed it was exclusively synthetic cherry flavoring. I love green teas, I even love to steep my teas for extended periods of time and never worry about straining the loose leaf ingredients, maybe these were faults of mine that made this tea so horrible but I tried over and over to brew it and even mix it with other teas I have to make it tolerable. The best result I got was taking a small pinch of this tea and adding it to a full glass of another to achieve a flavor akin to a Lysol disinfectant spray.	0	0
1	B004R8J8E0	A2VJJ2POCLMED7	Good stuff, but not very much of it...	The Pork Shake N Bake has always been a simple way to make any old chop a good bit tastier. With minimal mess, trouble and time, you get healthier-than-fried breaded chops that are juicy and taste good. It's not exactly gourmet, but after a long day, it's an easy way to start a meal without having to resort to fast food. The seasoning in the Shake N Bake make the pork sufficiently tasty, but doesn't overpower it like some mixes can.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that you may need more than one pouch if you're cooking more than 3 or 4 chops. I was probably being a bit liberal with them, but I had enough for three thick-cut boneless pork chops and there wasn't much left over (maybe a tablespoon). That's a minor gripe, but if you're cooking a lot of chops, especially thick ones, you're going to need more than a single pouch.	0	0
-1	B000XMMP76	A27VQJDNSCDATU	Don't waste your money on this oil!	This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made! It tastes like regular olive oil. I tasted it and then the Roland black truffle oil, and the Roland was far superior! Don't waste your money on this oil!!!!!!!	1	1
-1	B003EJ9KLO	ACVR1V1AZSW0N	You have got to be kidding me!	I tried this yesterday...frontier flapjacks?  You gotta be kidding me!<br />I never do a review and if something is bad I usually just toss it, but these were so lame I had to say something.<br /><br />Even on sale, they were a waste of money.  There is nothing hearty about them, they stuck to the pan, then fell apart (even after leaving them on longer (I know how to make german and american pancakes (with everything in them); so, this was ridiculous)).  All I wanted to do was see what a flapjack tasted like.  I love to hike; so, this seemed intriguing. I can't imagine frontierfolks eating these and being able to do all the things they needed to do.<br /><br />Yech!	1	16

-1	B000E7QYNG	AZS8MAGN4582L	Has live grain bugs	I received my order a couple of weeks ago.  The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles.  I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage.  I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds.  Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out.  This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.	7	0

1	B0007R9L4M	A2CKS52LNW9YUJ	Madras Lentils a good side dish	I've been eating various Indian retorted veggie entrees for a while now -- we use them as side dishes when I cook main dishes that may be, but aren't always, Indian. The Madras Lentils remind me a lot of really good Louisiana Red Beans (as in Red Beans & Rice--with or without sausage). Very flavorful and actually a bit meaty in taste. I first encountered them at Trader Joe's but it seems that they are going over to their own labels and they wouldn't admit that they were using TastyBite (see someone else's review of Punjabi Eggplant)so I'll stick with the original. I've also tried, and liked, the Punjabi Eggplant.	11	1

-1	B007M83302	A2YDU3RZB63VXW	Holy SALT, Batman!	"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."	45	7

I am impressed with the ingredients.  Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed...  Every time I have fed my dogs  any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00.	3	0

1	B001M09BTS	A2L2G946WCAWIW	Very tasty	I like this flavor a lot. When I make this I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of regular old fashioned oats. It makes it not quite so sweet and I like the texture of the non-instant oats. I just add water and cook in microwave for 3 minutes.

1	B002GWHAXK	AB1RAOEL2N9MU	As good as you'll get for the price	This is not the best coffee I've had. The best coffee I've had was shade grown and organic and from Cuba. The second best coffee I ever had passed through the digestive system of a rodent. I'm that guy. This coffee is pretty good. Not the best, nothing spectacular but tasty and enjoyable. And at 6 dollars a pound when you pay the same 6 dollars for 12 ounces of 6 o' clock coffee (which this is vastly superior too) at current prices it's an incredible deal.<br /><br />I was a little worried about the roast, some places say french roast but really don't mean it. This is not the darkest french roast ever but the beans do have a nice oily sheen to them.	1	0
-1	B004U49QU2	A25CZCHLNH3OMO	Not very good	"I saw the name ""Chips Ahoy!"" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.<br /><br />I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my two cents:<br /><br />1. The allegedly mega fudge filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. Minifudge filling would have been more accurate. The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.<br /><br />2. The cookie part tasted like fake chocolate, which was a turnoff for me. I love chocolate like nobody's business, but it has to be GOOD chocolate (which this was definitely NOT.) A chocolate candy bar of almost any kind would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips Ahoy."	1	0

-1	B000Q5X8DK	A2ZBLKE83EFNGA	Meh	"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice.""  Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.<br /><br />The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color.  We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are.<br /><br />These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should.  Our family didn't like them very much.  They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky."	31	5

The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much."	0	1

These four bags of delicious, mouth-watering beef nuggets are a tasty and healthy snack, and I don't feel bad about eating a whole bag throughout the day at my desk.<br /><br />I love all of the varieties Jack Link's has to offer. I've been a die-hard Teriyaki fan myself, so I'm hesitant to sway away from my typical ""go-to"" bag.<br /><br />If you're looking for a satisfying feel-good snack to take on road trips, sporting events, at your desk, or what-have-you ' you do NOT want to pass this up."	1	0
-1	B000CQG8B2	A243IZ5AUJMO79	This Flavor is Disgusting	I love some of their other teas, I'm a chocoholic, and I love hazelnut coffee.  But I HATED this flavor.  It reminds me of the pharmacy's first attempts years ago to flavor medicine--has a wonderful smell but a weird, almost disgusting aftertaste.  It actually made me a bit sick to my stomach!  I'll stick with the Vanilla Chai--very tasty.	4	1
-1	B001KUSLGY	A7EJERNB7IK3Z	Contains ERYTHRITOL and possibly GMO ingredients!  So dissapointed!	My wife and I were thrilled when we heard that there was a soda with Stevia used for a sweetner, instead of dangerous Aspartame or other artificial sweetners.  We went down to our local health food store, where we purchased several different flavors of 'Zevia', including their cola.  Imagine our surprise when we read one of the ingredients listed as erythritol, a sugar alcohol!  And then we learned that it very well could be made from GMO (genetically modified) corn!  Our quest for a truly natural, non GMO, stevia only soda continues!	6	3
1	B001BCXTGS	A3MZNRSDQ32UUH	my cats can't get enough	I have tried a lot, I mean a whole lot of cat food.  My two cats are so picky and I can never really tell what they will eat.  They loved the first can of this and I thought, well, we will see what happens in a coupld days.  They go through food like Sherman through Atlanta and even though I have only had the food for a couple of days, they have eaten six cans!  Little piglets.  I love this food.  The consistency is nice and juicey and my cats appreciate that.  If you are looking for a good quality, tasty food, order this.	0	1
1	B002R81L92	A24HLVLOGJYWH7	choclate covered	Product is delicious.  However we ordered the last shipment in July. Since the hot weather we recieved the item in chunk form as it had melted and stuck together rendering it unedible.  Recommend this item but not for shipment in hot weather.	0	0
1	B003LECIDE	A3M6HM6ADOZKSC	This stuff is great!	I use this stuff all the time - I would say it resembles Splenda, but tp me does not have the aftertaste Splenda does. I use it daily for all my sugar needs.	0	0
-1	B0069AFIN4	A1C9JNBZRLE9QH	A non-competitive price!	Don't understand why that people are happy with the price here. Please check other stores or online shops, you can just easily find much cheaper price than this. Even more than 10 dollars difference as compare to Sam's Club.	0	1
-1	B006W5WAL4	A3IW32CDRQLXQ	Disappointed	Extremely disappointed. I trusted the brand and got a 4-pack. But this product is just too sweet. And there are barely any raisins in them. I would rather go for any in-house brand (like Ralphs) and get a better cereal than this. This cereal is very unhealthy.	0	0
-1	B007PA33NY	A30CBK8V27QMML	Nice bold K-Cup but left a weird after taste	This is a good choice for a K-Cup if you like a bold rich cup of coffee. I ordered this brand for 3-4 months because it  was the best tasting bold K-Cup I found.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars because the last few shipments were not that great. It left both me and my husband with a weird metallic taste after one cup.<br /><br />I ordered Martinson's bold K-Cups about a month ago and loved it! I probably will not buy this brand again.	0	0

I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing.	1	0
1	B000KFXEYE	A3RHPBNP2N9RJB	Real Candy Cane Shavings In This!	This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.	0	0
1	B001AG6BMO	A3GQQBM0NP6V93	Tastes Great	I'm not a coconut oil savant, but I got this for my stovetop popcorn popper and it's awesome.  It's not super-greasy, very light, cooks the popcorn to perfection and leaves an amazing hint of coconut without the sweetness (although my husband says it doesn't get the coconut hint, but he misses a lot of hints).  It shipped quickly, was well-packaged, and is a good price, I didn't want to buy a ton in case we didn't like it.	0	0
1	B004SRH2B6	A3L6ZKXE115LSC	For those of you whom are new to Coconut water ... It truly is premium.	I have tried numerous brands of Coconut Water and this is one of the best.  The container really comes in handy, because you don't always want to drink an entire container in one sitting.  This bottle allows you to finish later or even another day.  I highly recommend this product and I suggest replacing your sugary sports drinks with this product.  Try it!	0	1
-1	B000EYPNCW	A2Q039A0P1Z6H	Love all there other Sensible Fruit Products but not this one.	I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all.<br /><br />However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet.  I would say it should be called Salty Corn.<br /><br />I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also, or change the Name to Salty Corn.  Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company-- I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line.  ** My<br /><br />Favorite is : Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend ...	1	4
-1	B005DX8YHU	A2BJ7414ZCP0PC	Horrible	Tastes nothing like kara age. Followed the directions on the package and it tasted horrible.

-1	B000LSUOZW	A2IEX63PVA49R5	Honey Candy	I have ordered these before from the Vermont Country Store and they were much better. However all the wrapping is the same, so I'm thinking I got a poor batch.  Otherwise they are Great for a soar throat or a raspy throat.	0	0
-1	B007VA2EOC	A1U7YF08MK5WVO	OVER PRICED	This product retails at $4.99.  I assumed the price was due to the description saying the shipping weight was 6 lb, meaning I would received a larger amount.  Clearly it was not 6 lb given that the bottle is under 1 lb.  Basically, you end up paying well over 2 times what you should - $12.99 for 12 ounces.	0	2
1	B001R3BQNY	AWLJHQ8MO08I4	Great for the price	The orange is my favorite flavor.  I prefer the other two flavors mixed together better than I like them separately.  I feel good after drinking them, like I do with other energy drinks.  I don't feel jittery like I do with too much coffee.  I will definitely order again.  I will save a fortune not buying Red Bull.	0	0
-1	B005GYYZTC	A2IFYWQ4RC21NE	This Was So Gross It Wouldn't Stay Down	I used to purchase a microwaveable Pad Thai by Thai Kitchen at my local grocery store that was a Thai version of cup-o-noodles, edible but not tasty. You had to fill the container with hot water, let sit for a few minutes then drain and stir in freeze-dried veggies and powdered sauce packet. I thought this was that product with a new package. I was severely mistaken. I bought this product because it is gluten free and I was flying to France for a vacation. I took 3 of the packages along with me to hold me over on the flight. In the last 2 hours of our flight, I pulled it out and much to my surprise the noodles did not need cooking (if you can call soaking in hot water for a few minutes cooking) and the sauce was already a liquid. I tried my hardest to eat it but it was just too disgusting that I was only able to eat approximately 1/3 of it. As we began to prepare for landing, I started to feel very ill and ended up puking everywhere. I travel quite frequently by plane (including independently owned planes) but this was the first time in my life that I have ever thrown up in a plane. In addition, I have never been motion sick in my life, therefore I attribute my sickness entirely to this product.	0	0
-1	B0002L3BYE	A14DXNSC7A7XBP	J. W.	This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.  It has a chemical taste, like you're eating spun plastic, and makes you actually scared to eat it.  Why even bother eating it.  I'll stick with fat free whipped topping -- at least it has flavor.	9	2
1	B001ACMCLM	ADDDFVHP3CSVA	Great Gluten Free Alternative	Using this Chebe mix for Pizza crusts, bread sticks, and dinner rolls are all very good bets.

-1	B000OUNXXW	ATJN4KEHJBOC8	Has a ton of fillers, but the cats like the taste	"Okay, I admit it.<br />I was sucked in my the most adorable, romantic commercials for a cat food product that I have<br />ever seen. I vowed to buy at least some Fancy Feast each week just to show my support for that commercial!  LOL<br /><br />The cats love the wet food. It is very expensive, and from what I have read on the labels, you are<br />definitely paying for the IMAGE, not the quality or quantity of the food. (The cans are only 3 ounces<br />compared with 5.5 ounces in the other can styles.) I still get it, and they love the ones with cheese the most.<br /><br />So, I thought we'd give the dry food a try. I had my husband grab a bag when he was at the grocery store.<br />How bad could it be, right?  Same company, same ""gourmet"" promotion on the foods, so surely it has great stuff<br />in it, right?  Well, shocker - NOPE.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is made by the Purina company in St Louis, MO. They are the same ones who make the generic dog chow,<br />cat chow, rabbit chow, ________ (fill in the blank) critter chow.  They are all full of fillers that animals don't need,<br />because it is cheap to manufacture. Why I thought this might be different, I do not know.<br /><br />First off, food mfgs have found the kitty equivalent of addictive MSG, and load their foods with it.<br />This one is no different. Note that BOTH our cats went crazy over this food, inhaling it out of my hand<br />before I could even get more out of the package. Fancy Feast knows how to make things that smell/taste good to cats.<br />However, most food mfgs know how to make things that TASTE good - how they got there, well, you might not really want to know.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients list (which is in the order of the QUANTITY of the item) for this ""gourmet"" cat chow - bear with me, this is<br />a really long list of iffy ingredients, artificial junk and food coloring):<br /><br />Brewers Rice<br />Poultry By Product Meal<br />CORN GLUTEN meal<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Soybean Meal<br />Animal Liver Flavor<br />Chicken<br />Turkey<br />Phosphoric Acid<br />Calcium Carbonate (in case they get indigestion?! This is what's in Tums!)<br />Salt<br />Natural & Artificial Flavors<br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dried Yeast<br />Choline Chloride<br />Added Color, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2 and ""other colors"" (Why?!?)<br />Taurine<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Ferrous Sulfate<br />Vitamin E Supplement<br />Niacin<br />Manganese Sulfate<br />Vitamin A Supplement<br />Calcium Pantothenate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Copper Sulfate<br />Riboflavin Supplement<br />Vitamin B12 Supplement<br />Pyridoxine<br />Hydrochloride<br />Folic Acid<br />Vitamin D3 Supplement<br />Calcium Iodate<br />Biotin<br />Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (a form of Vit K)<br />Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />Sounds yummy, huh?<br />The meat is way down the list, after all the corn, soybean and rice fillers and glutens.<br /><br />How on earth does cat food need artificial food dyes?  The cats won't care.<br />There are many known reactions to food dyes in people - I am sure our pets don't need it either.<br />Was the food too yellow with all the grain meal and gluten, or too white from all the fats?<br /><br />So, the cats love it. I will now consider this the equivalent of a bag of potato chips for humans -<br />okay some times, but NOT all the time. I'll have to watch our oldest cat. He gets super itchy with wheat<br />grain or gluten in foods, so I'll watch for reactions to the corn.<br /><br />Cats are carnivorous, and do not eat grains in the wild. However, especially with the manufacturing plant<br />smack dab in farming country, they can apparently get all kinds of leftover grains cheap?<br /><br />If you buy this for your kitties, just know that you are buying the IMAGE more than a quality food.<br />This is not really different than the super cheap pet food.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed to read that ingredients list, when they could do SO much better for our pets.<br />We'll use this as their treats, rather than their main dry food. We'll stick with our Blue Buffalo for that, which is<br />grain free and actually has meat for the first ingredient!<br /><br />Fancy Feast - marketing genius, but sloppy on the nutrition."	0	0
-1	B0033HPPIY	A3DS7WOLV4J60N	Very disappointing	I tried this, despite some of the negative reviews, since the positive reviews outweighed the bad ones. But it looks like the negative reviews have it. While brewing, it has a distinct smell of cinnamon, which got me excited. Note: it smelled like raw cinnamon, not a cinnamon roll. That's about the only positive. Otherwise, it kind of tasted like bad coffee with a hint of dirt. I tired it on all the settings, too - 6 oz, 8 oz, and 10 oz, and they were all terrible. I won't try this flavor again, or other novel flavors by Green Mountain.	0	0
1	B000FFRU3U	A2LP9JOB8H0BA4	Very nice and convenient, healthy and tasty!	I'm revising my review and rating this higher than I originally did.  At first I thought this variety was bland and unexciting.  But after going through a few cups of it I look forward to it.  I like the real dried fruit in it, the peaches and raspberries are a good match.  I also like that it's a mix of oatmeal and barley. It adds to the texture of the product.<br /><br />-great to throw in a bag for breakfast at the office. Very convenient - add boiling water and steep several minutes, or add water and microwave the cup!<br /><br />-Great portion size: about the size of two single serve packets of oatmeal all in one<br /><br />-8 grams of fiber per cup and fairly low in sugars<br /><br />-Vegan and fairly non processed	2	0
1	B0002ZFPAS	A1ZM0O9R4IN85Y	Best dog bones ever	I have a super strong chewer, a weimaraner, and this product is by far the best I've come across.

Not only a good bone but also inexpensive compared to other indestructable bones (often more than $10 cheaper).	0	0

My single sample arrived in a huge box. The ""green"" in me cringed; first warning. Then the packet had only the instruction of ""mixing with 250 ml of water"". Second warning.  How long should I steep it? no idea. When the drink was, what I thought was ready,i.e. mixed with the correct amount of hot water, I tried it - wow, the ginger taste was intense! I added 1/2 again the amount of water and reheated it. This was better, but still very powerful. I went back to the packaging to see the make-up of the product -no information was provided; a description of some of the ingredients does come on the full supply box but I did not have that to see. (I went back to the listing for this fact). Strike three. Then I checked the caloric content - still no details. Maybe that is on the box, but that was nowhere to my knowledge. The fourth and fatal blow. I cannot recommend this product as it tastes too strong, has no indication of specifically what it is made of and no caloric details. Too bad, the concept was good."	0	0
-1	B008JKSJJ2	AHCGFCP5YW99O	They didn't taste that great...	The price was excellent & I heard many good things about the Kind bars... but the mango macadamia bar didn't taste all that great. I would be willing to try other flavors, but I would not buy this flavor again.	1	0
-1	B000ORXYYS	A5CMZNXDFELI7	"5lb bag is very small, tastes great, bad digestive ""issues"""	Anyone with common sense would probably figure out that a 5lb bag of Xylitol would be smaller than a 5lb bag of Splenda.  However, I was actually surprised when it arrived.  It was about 2/3 the size of a 5lb bag of sugar!  So, I guess Xylitol weighs more than sugar, which makes it really, really, really expensive, instead of just really expensive.<br /><br />This stuff tastes great and really does not have an aftertaste.  I had been using Splenda, but wanted to get away from using artificial sweeteners.  However, a huge drawback is the digestive problems I get every time I use Xylitol.  I started out by just using a tsp/day in my coffee and thought I'd be able to work up to more.  Nope, every time I try to use more, I spend the day in the bathroom.  Literally, all day.  Gross, but you need to know what this stuff will do to you!  The good news is that it will last a long time since I can only consume a tsp/day.	15	0

All three dogs love the  duck and potato dog food so the switch was easy...although the dog food is expensive. Anyway, when I saw these duck jerky treats I had to try them.

That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product."	2	0
-1	B0059YB39O	A93AG3JQQVXOZ	Regular is Salty--Peppered is Great	I would say I get less salt from sucking on a handful of sunflower seeds. This was horrible. Despite what the package says this is not the original jerky. I would eat a bag a day back in 2005 and 2006, so I was so excited to see this but it did not taste at all like the jerky from way back then.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just ate the thin peppered beef jerky and was surprised by the difference between the flavor of the peppered and the original flavor. Two thumbs up for the peppered jerky, in fact they don't even tast like they were made from the same company. I will make sure to always only buy peppered.	0	0

-1	B005A1LJ04	A3UC3YT2E65LZO	Awful	Let me be clear: I wasn't expecting this to taste like a top-shelf margarita from the local bar... but I was truly surprised by just how nasty this stuff is.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet and pouring the off-white powder into a pitcher, I was immediately greeted by a smell I can only describe as being very similar to dishwasher detergent.  The powder went from off-white to neon green as soon as it came in contact with water, which is sort of fascinating.  As the water poured into the pitcher, the detergent smell became more pronounced, along with what could best be described as the aroma of lemon-scented furniture polish.<br /><br />I gave it a thorough stir and put it in the refrigerator to chill.<br /><br />A few hours later, I poured some into a glass.  The smell was just as strange as before.  I took one sip, and sure enough, it tasted just like it smelled.  I took another sip, hoping my tastebuds would perhaps adjust and that I'd somehow like it... but no dice.  I had to dump it out and grab a soda to get the detergent/furniture polish taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Long story short, this stuff is foul.	1	1

-1	B0002NYO70	A1L2DYZIMPXA9X	Nice mix, but..	I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault.	15	1

This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation.  It is not organic (one reviewer described finding it in the ""organic"" section of their local grocery store).  The label on the bag claims ""100% pure & natural granola"" (this claim is meaningless) and on the back has the following:<br />""No artificial flavors; No cholesterol; No hydrogenated oils; No high fructose corn syrup; No artificial preservatives; 0 g trans fat""<br /><br />Notice it does NOT claim to be GMO-free and the likelihood is that this granola DOES contain GMOs, as it has non-organic canola oil.  Please be aware that ""Bear Naked"" is not some folksy brand - it is a subsidiary of Kelloggs...the same Kelloggs that has donated substantial amounts of money to defeat a California November 6th Right-to-Know Ballot Initiative (Proposition 37) that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods and would, in the words of the Organic Consumers Organization put ""an end to the unethical practice, unfortunately common even in the alternative food sector, of marketing or labeling GMO-tainted food as ""natural.""<br /><br />The group GMO Free USA, has launched campaign #1: Boycott Kelloggs, noting ""In this digital age, you have to wonder why a company would spend more money than it could possibly cost to change their product labels to fight against the consumer's right to know what we are eating.""<br /><br />Why, they might even have to label a seemingly ""clean"" brand like Bear Naked with the truth...and then how much of this phony product would they sell?

1	B0039QS49Q	AADPMOGU788O6	Just what the doctor ordered.	It is a fact that I am a dehydrating fan. My vegetable garden products are not only eaten fresh but I conserve them by canning and dehydrating on a regular basis. I was a bit hesitant to try food that someone else had dried until a friend introduced me to Harmony House dried foods. She is an avid backpacker and hiker and practically lives off dried food on her rambles. Once I had tried the dried tomato dices I was sold. This product is wonderful and has a rich very satisfying tomato taste without the aftertaste that some products have. It is pure nature in all its splendor. Since then I have added a number of Harmony House dried foods to my emergency stash and use them on a regular basis in soups, stews, breads, dips, etc. Take my word for it, you won't go wrong with this product.

I ordered one bottle and would mix this in with water, juice, or when I was really tired take a shot or spoonful.<br /><br />This juice lasted me 3 times as long as one 32 ounce bottle of goji juice. It isn't the best tasting but for energy and curbing your appetite this concentrate works wonders!<br /><br />Since I have been drinking this concentrate I have lost 9 pounds. Not to mention my sex drive is much higher, I feel more focused than ever before, and have not been munching or eating all day like I use to.<br /><br />I would recommend this concentrate over goji juice any day.

1	B000LKUTIM	A35MRD2W2M9V0Q	Best gluten-free linguine	Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is a good gluten-free substitute for gluten-based linguine. This corn-quinoa blend looks like gluten-based linguine when cooked, and while not the same as gluten-based, the texture is much better than most rice-based pastas - it doesn't have an al dente bite, but it does twirl up on a fork, if not overcooked.  The flavor is not typical of linguine, but it's also not off-flavored - it's neutral-flavored and pairs well with red sauces, and is also acceptable with delicate or mild sauces.  To prevent the pasta from sticking or clumping, follow the directions, and in addition, stir the water while adding the pasta, so that it doesn't have the chance to stick together.  For those on gluten-free diets, this quinoa linguine is the closest I've tasted to gluten-based and can be served to the whole family without complaint.<br />Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is organic, made in the USA, and manufactured in a gluten-free facility.<br />Each serving has 205 calories, 46 g carbs, 4 g protein, 1 g fat, 4 mg sodium, 0 mg cholesterol.<br />Ingredients: organic corn flour, organic quinoa flour.	7	0
-1	B0042MCJ74	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Gritty? Why so much sugar?	"I don't know if it was a problem with bad storage, but this peanut butter was filled with grit from one of the ingredients: ""evaporated cane juice"" which is actually raw sugar. It precipitated out in the peanut butter and made a gritty consistency. And of course, it was too sweet. The raisins didn't show until half the jar was used, and the cinnamon flavor was weak.<br /><br />This is nice on celery for ""ants on a log"" (celery, peanut butter, raisins) which is a great kiddy snack--oh, who'm I foolin? I love it, too. But the use of the sugar made this too sweet and the texture even on crunchy celery isn't great.<br /><br />Why don't they use molasses or honey as a sweetener? And less of it; raisins are plenty sweet as they are.<br /><br />Not really recommended."	0	0
-1	B000LRIKUE	A3E755O7FW1OIG	Great product, BUT IT IS NOT HALAL!	The product in and of itself is great.  The chicken bouillon has great flavor and works well in recipes.  But, I called the manufacturer of this product today (Nestle USA) and they told me that they do not have halal certification for this product here in the United States.  Therefore, it is not halal.  The man told me that they do sell a milk product called Milo, which can be found here in the US as halal.  But, this product is not halal.  I just wanted to write this review because the message behind it is so important for my Muslim brothers and sisters out there.	3	3

I don't think I'll order these in the future.<br /><br />I do, however, like that they're not super high in calories and that they do have a lot of protein in them. I also like that they're all natural. I'm going to give them another try just out of courtesy, but I don't think it's going to get better with a different bar.	0	0

1	B0013P3KC6	AQDKKTFH5XREM	Good for on the go, even though you will pay for the packaging.	I brought some of these packets with me today so that I could sweeten my tea at work and realized that I made too much coffee for the amount of Xylitol that I had originally put into it before I took off for my commute.<br /><br />The packaging has to be 'special' because Xlyitol is pretty 'humid', in that regular paper packaging would not be optimal.<br /><br />I write this because, although it's perfect for on the go, and the packaging is pretty much 'unavoidable' in regards to properly storing and transporting it, it was a pain in the butt to open one to two packets whilst driving (I had to wait for the next stoplight or I would've veered off of the road in my struggle to open the dang things!).<br /><br />All-in-all a great product. Even after having a 'sweetened' cup of coffee, I don't have a 'fuzzy' mouth, like sugar would normally do!	2	1

This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.<br />Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.<br />These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.<br />I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.<br />I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.<br />All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.<br /><br />The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!	1	0

It's not necessarily the ZICO flavor i grab after a workout, as i still love pineapple (though chocolate is great in my morning recovery smoothie), but it has definitely replaced my mid-afternoon snacking habit in a much healthier way.

I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around!

There is a ""note"" in there - almost an aftertaste - that just did not taste good to me. I thought this would be more like margarita mix I guess than an actual margarita but it tastes to me like the mix plus a fakey sort of tequila type taste that I just didn't like at all.<br /><br />I think if you're someone who really likes margaritas but has to watch your carbs/calories then maybe this wouldn't be a bad alternative but for me it just wasn't it.

Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.	2	0

This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness.

1	B0027Z8V4S	A2M98GZABSMIOR	Kicking decaf!	"Most, if not all coffee drinkers would agree that decaf coffee just doesn't taste as good as caffeinated. Great caffeinated beans (whatever ""great"" means to the drinker) are pretty easy to find. But when it comes to decaf, pickin's get VERY slim.<br /><br />Kicking Horse is the best decaf for me. It's an even, very dark (consider it a french) roast and it's oily! (The whole ""oily vs. not oily"" is a never-ending debate.) Suffice to say, I prefer dark, oily beans and it's impossible to find oily decaf from a mass-production roaster.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have not performed a side-by-side comparison with caffeinated, but straight shots are remarkable. Few people would recognize that they were drinking decaf if they were served this coffee. (espresso or press, i can't speak to the taste of this coffee after drip)<br /><br />To qualify any opinion, it's important to understand the perspective of the reviewer. I don't evaluate coffee for qualities like ""florals"" or ""dark chocolate"" or ""berries"". I like rich espresso flavor, but without so much caffeine. So I cut my coffee with a dark decaf in order to get the richness that I want, and then smooth it with a little milk/cream - no sweetener, no flavorings.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I really appreciate the 15% discount for the monthly automated Amazon subscription."	1	2

We are very pleased with all items in the box.<br /><br />With that said, My only real complaint is price.  The 4.4 pounds includes everything - even the packaging.  The quantities are not being shown in the product description as I write this review.  This is not a lot more than a product sampling package, yet the Amazon price at this moment is an even $40.  That works out to very expensive ""per ounce pricing"" if you purchased each of the items individually.<br /><br />But there is one additional positive.  It's become common to expect ""gift baskets"" and other types of gift selections to be priced very high.  If you're willing to pay the money for a very nice gift, that's exactly what you'll be giving - a very nice gift.<br /><br />Had it not been for the pricing, this would have been a very solid 4-star rating (we give VERY few 5-star ratings - they truly have to be the best of the best to get 5 stars from us."	8	0

1	B005QF5X6K	AMK54CNMJ7LCX	Very good experience!	Ordering with this seller is a must! I ordered some Valrhona Chocolate and since I live in Florida, I was a little afraid that my chocolate melted by the time it was delivered. Not at all!!! The packaging has a very good protection with ice bags and special paper... So my chocolate was still a little bite cold when I opened it. The Valrhona chocolate is different from all the others since it has a true flavor, not fat, just right, unique... Yes, it's more expensive but if you want to impress, cook with it!	0	0

This product came up as the #2 selection, and the price was good, so I bought it. After it arrived, I noticed that it had cane sugar in the ingredients. You would think with unsweetened in the search engine, Amazon would do a better sorting job than to have a sweetened version as the #2 choice. My fault for not looking more closely. Live and learn, the Amazon search engine isn't perfect.<br />Since I cannot have sugar, I cannot rate the product."	5	9

My dog liked the treat. He also had some fun chewing the treat, so it was good for chewing and as food.<br />I can also state that the treats did not affect his health either positively or negatively. His stool was also consistent pre-treat and post-treat. In other words, the treats are safe to give to your dog.	0	0

-1	B001TLY7BM	A1DD4B97M4DUC5	Mostly great	My cats love about half the Weruva flavors and most flavors look so good that I've been tempted to try them.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say is that the *Marbella Paella* includes calamari, but like everything else it isn't mashed down to little pieces.<br /><br />****One of the cans contained a 1.5 inch long WHOLE squid**** and it was rather big surprise for me to open the can and see that...  I'm not going to buy this type in the future.

1	B0006G5KF8	A2OL0SADJOFH8T	Love the Taste	This is an excellent rice seasoning, not too salty, sweet or fishy. It is best used after the rice is cooked.

The colors were not vibrant like regular food color, but were pretty and rich.  At least in the uncooked cake batter.  But when the cakes came out of the oven, there was no trace of color at all.  It looked like I had just baked regular yellow cake with no dye whatsoever.  I was so so sad to be serving plain cake in a jar.	3	1

-1	B000EPMP2W	A250AXLRBVYKB4	Good not Great	Ka-Me makes a lot of different rice/noodle dishes, some of which are really quite good for prepared meals. This variety, however, is not their best. The noodles are ok, but the Szechuan flavoring is not to my taste. It's a bit generic and a little too salty.

1	B003TNANSO	A14R9XMZVJ6INB	Delicious and nutricious!	I like protein bars conceptually - something to grab as you rush out - I go to a lot of 6 pm meetings,  and plan to eat dinner when they end,  but by then I'm ravenous,  and I need something to hold me through them.  So I've tried a lot of bars and frankly they range around mediocre,  pretending to be something (chocolate!)that they are clearly not.<br /><br />So what are these bars like?  Great!  Really delicious - full of nuts you can see and taste,  not too sweet,  as often these bars are, and it has protein!  A happy find,  we bought a box and will buy more,  I can see it becoming a staple in our cupboards.<br /><br />May 2010 - on to my third order,  so this is a really great snack in our house.  The protein really does help fill you up,  it's a perfect snack,  and all of us think it's delicious (though my son does prefer the macadamia passionfruit, this one has protein and that makes it a much better bar for me and my husband and our low sugar tendencies)	13	0
1	B005CUU25G	A1NOV41485TE0D	Dogs like it!	I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!	0	0
-1	B000G17682	A1LH299PZXB0VD	Only the barest resemblance to the real thing	"Besides being organic I can't find much of anything else positive to say about this product.

And there's not even a hint of any of the vegetables taht are supposed to be in Tom Kha Phak.  If you're in desperate straits and you need something remotely ""ethnic"" and are not hypertensive then this might work since it does have coconut milk in it.

""Native Forests"" like California and Georgia grow great peaches, why do they need to come from China? It's no secret that organic certification in China is HIGHLY questionable so you can't rely on this product to actually be organic.<br /><br />Also, the other reviewer states the cans are lined with BPA. Double shame, Native Forest!<br /><br />I love canned peaches, but I will not eat another until Native Forest or another company comes out with organic, steam-peeled peaches grown in the USA and canned in BPA-free cans."	13	7

1	B0006VB3SG	AFDCIGPD9V3NF	Keeps my dog busy!	I have been ordering the everlasting treats for a while now and they really are a great way to keep my Goldendoodle busy.  I have a very bright and powerful chewer who likes to be part of the action at all times.  I only bring these out every few weeks or so because she looses interest if I give them to her too often.  The only down side I would say is that she works on them for so long her paws do have a tendency to get a little smelly and wet so they do need to be cleaned off afterwards.  The key is a treat ball - keep an eye on it.  Once they get stretched out the refills are too easy to pop out.	0	0

1	B001LG945O	ASKH6TPNTTAFS	Interesting switch from soda	"Like many others, I found The Switch Orange Tangerine to be a little hard to classify. It's not too sweet, and not too tart, with a lot of flavor. But it distinctly tastes ""blended"" - creating a ""real"" flavor by playing with others.<br /><br />It doesn't really claim to be healthy, it just insinuates it in a number of ways. On the other hand, it's not too overly sweet like a typical soda and I found the carbonation was just about right.<br /><br />Bottom line - it's fairly tasty, but the small size for the price is a downside."	1	1
-1	B000DZH19U	A2ZIFZJ6NDMPHK	Taste Great, Sugar Content TOO HIGH, First ingredient	Sugar is the FIRST ingredient on the package (Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar), however, when Amazon lists the ingredients they do not list them in the order on the package. Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.<br />They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient.	2	0
-1	B000G0EP78	AI2IWWHVNHD8V	Waste of Money	I've tried 3 different recipes with Carbquik.  I used it to bread chicken- just barely ok.  The biscuits I tried were terrible.  The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.  They didn't hold together when I put them in the boiling chicken broth to cook.  I had to pitch the doughy mess and order dinner out.  The mix its self has a peculiar odor that is unappetizing.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	4	0
1	B000EPR1J4	A2FAWO0517YUWE	We LOVE these crackers!	"These are the greatest crackers, either alone, or with a slice of cheese, or with a dip.  There's just enough wasabi to spice up what could otherwise be a dull-tasting rice cracker.  Yes, we like some of the other Ka-Me flavors OK, especially the black sesame <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHMWS2"">Ka-me Rice Crunch Cracker Black Sesame And Soy Sauce, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and the seaweed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPMP36"">Ka-Me Rice Crunch, Seaweed, 3.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a>.  But these wasabi ones are our favorites!<br /><br />We can buy these in the New York area;  in Michigan, we can get some other Ka-Me flavors but not wasabi;  and in Southern California we can't find Ka-Me crackers at all!  Go figger.  So it's great to have Amazon supply our ""cracker fix"" when we travel to the many places where these crackers seem to be extinct.<br /><br />By the way, they are also gluten-free, if you care about that.  Some folks think avoiding gluten, even if you're not actually allergic to it, can help weight control.  I look at it a different way - these crackers are only 7 calories each, and satisfying far beyond their calories - so they're sort of a diet food."	0	0
-1	B000HE86QY	A11ACQW8RYEVMF	shipped fast, no weight specified	I received the shipment quickly; however, I was a little disappointed when I opened the box as it was only a 5 ounce package.  I bought another color of sprinkles from a different company, paid the same price and got 16 ounces.  The seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price.  I took the risk because I needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them.  I will know next time to ask the question before purchasing.	0	0
1	B0019RLJV2	A1JADFWTTDPITL	The Cheesiest.	"As I sit here, with a mouth full of this fine Kraft product, I can't help but remember that fateful December afternoon. The war had ended some time ago, yet you could still hear the resentment resonating through the townsfolk's gnashed teeth. Jake and I were at the bar, as usual, trying to drink away the sun. The barkeep, sliding a filthy rag across the counter, squinted as he tried to read our shirts. He let a grin escape and shook his head.<br /><br />""You got a problem, old man?"" Jake took off his glasses.<br /><br />The barkeep ran his forearm across his wrinkled face. ""Ain't no problem here. You boys have guts, is all, wearin' those Kraft logos around these parts. This is a Stouffer's county.""<br /><br />Jake stood up, sliding his stool back across the hardwood floor. ""If I wanted to choke down frozen food, I'd move my ass to Alaska. I'll take The Cheesiest any day."" We used to call him Jake the Patriot. Always looking for a fight. I grabbed his arm in a vain attempt to pacify him. Looking around the room, I saw we were vastly outnumbered.<br /><br />""Choose your next words carefully, son. Don't look like you're makin' many friends here."" The bar patrons began edging closer to us. There was a wild look in their eyes; the kind that only came from malnutrition. I felt a moment of pity for them. Who could deny the inherent benefits of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese?<br /><br />Jake discreetly slipped brass knuckles on underneath the counter. ""You heard me."" He turned, addressing the whole room. ""Stouffer's is garbage."" The patrons exploded. Frozen bricks of macaroni were tossed at us. We fought off near twenty men, leaving each one with regret. Jake turned back to the barkeep, spitting blood onto the floor. ""That, old man, is why Kraft will always win.""<br /><br />As we walked out, stepping over the injured men on the ground, the old man called after us. ""You boys forgot one thing."" He walked to the back-room door. ""Mastodons love Stouffer's."" He flung open the door and dove under the bar. A giant mastodon crashed through the frame, charging directly at us. I luckily threw myself out of the way. Jake, the poor kid, was not so fortunate. I watched in horror as the giant animal gored him with its tusks. It dropped Jake, looked around, and walked out as quickly as it came. I ran over to Jake's body, crying out. He looked up at me, his life slowly slipping away.<br /><br />""Keep up the good fight, buddy. Never forget what Stouffer's has done to me. Tell the world."" He was gone. Since that day, a rage has been building inside me. This injustice cannot be forgiven.<br /><br />I call upon all of you to eat the delicious Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in memory of Jake. Tell your friends. As you're stirring The Cheesiest cheese into boiled macaroni, just think. One day, we will be able to live without fear of the Stouffer's Mastodon."	157	25
-1	B0018Q6KNQ	A1XZ2R37RYKZXI	Reacted very badly to this pasta	My wife and I ate the recommended serving (2 oz dried). It was delicious, and we felt full afterwards. Later that night, neither of us slept well because we were so hungry. I don't know if this is related, but we both had heart palpitations that night.<br /><br />We both woke up feeling starved. I usually don't even feel hungry in the morning! My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us. We're throwing out all the boxes that I bought based on the 5 star ratings here. If you want to try it, start with a single box and see how it makes you feel.	1	1

I plan on buying two or three more of them because they are ""prepper friendly.""  No, I am not preparing for an apoc experience.  I simply like to keep a stock of good food on hand.  This ham is safe in the can for around 5 years.  If you want to have something on hand for unexpected guests then this is the thing to buy.  It's a product of Denmark.  Everyone knows that Denmark has the best hams.<br /><br />The price is more than right and the ease of use is, well, easy.  Did I mention that I really like this ham?"	0	0
1	B000WFKWDI	A3TPLK0JV6NKK6	Wellness is a great grain-free option	"I agree with Lizzie.  :)<br /><br />I purchase cases of the 12.5 ounce cans for my cats at the local mom and pop pet supply store.  It is the only brand that they consistently will eat that is grain free.  I have two cats that only eat wet food and use one 12.5 ounce can per day.  It's a great bargain compared to the smaller cans.  I would purchase it online if the cost with shipping was closer to what I pay at the local store.<br /><br />If you're trying to go GRAIN FREE or at least ALL WET FOOD for your kitties, do try Wellness.  I have tried nearly every type of grain free or lower grain or organic/natural canned cat food there is available; while my cats will eat some of the other stuff sometimes, they like Wellness the best.  I only feed them the plain Turkey and Chicken flavors, since they usually don't do too well with beef or seafood.<br /><br />(Note:  by grain free I mean no corn, wheat, or soy.  If you look at the ingredient list, there are sweet potatoes and other vegetables/fruits, so it is not just protein.)<br /><br />GO GRAIN FREE!  It's better for the kitties.<br />My 12 and 13 year old cats are shinier, healthier, and more active now that they've changed to this diet over the last year.  My fat cat lost weight and no longer has flaky skin.  They only throw up hairballs now instead of the frequent ""other"" vomits before.  And the diarrhea that was plaguing one cat for the previous two years has completely ended.  Solid, regular poops - believe me, it's a relief (yes, I know it's gross to talk about, but it's true!).<br /><br />I may take the final step to RAW DIET for them... haven't decided yet.  But at least I know on this food they are thriving."	6	0

-1	B0051VNLHW	A3KIHMMRH4XDEF	Expected More...	I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.	0	0
1	B005VOONKI	A3H78NCT3DJMY2	Nice Coffee, Pods Didn't Work for Us	I really love the idea of this coffee from the family of Bob Marley. However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.<br /><br />Not wanting to waste the coffee, I cut up a bunch and brewed in a regular machine. Overall, it's a fairly mild roast with good strong coffee flavor (if you use enough of it) that has some nice fruity tones.	1	2

She eats just about anything, but wouldn't touch the bananas.  I don't blame her.  They smelled awful and they were pink.  But she ate the apples and pears just fine with her plain yogurt.  I wouldn't buy this food again for the food.  The pouches with mixed fruits are much better.	0	0

1	B0002MLA5K	A1VY0DT9IKMX54	I love Hills!	My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!	6	0

1	B005X5GBEG	A23HFHDZETNKW5	Better than the rest	What I like about Samu is that it is different from the rest of the coconut waters I've had. Its not over-powering with sweet, but has just the right about. It's also an amazing chaser and combines well for tropical drinks. Lastly, its high quality, not something from a random asian grocery store.	2	3
1	B000ITT9ZA	A24MMRIQSYGMBV	Great taste, great sauce... just needs a tad more heat!	For starters, the bottle is made of thick & heavy glass which is very durable to take with you when on the go. The taste is very good, and tastes pretty much as you would expect it to. My only wish is that it would have been a bit hotter. Its heat is very very mild (IMO), which surprised me considering the ingredients do in fact list Jalapenos and Habaneros. Other than that, its well worth the money!	0	0
-1	B000E4ARD2	ABJXWXX88GI2N	Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky (Barbeque Flavor)	This was not that great.  I only tried this brand's Barbeque flavor so I don't know what the rest tastes like (to be fair).  I will not be buying this again.  I have tried several brands and so far the best one is Perky Jerky Turkey Jerky.  Someone complained about Jack Links being too salty but I rather that than this bad tasting barbeque junk.	1	0

-1	B0033YXSHW	A2FD9B8CMYY78R	Good Brand - No So Good Cereal	I like most of this company's line a lot. But this one has some problems. The first reviewer talked about there being little chocolate. Well, I found plenty of chocolate, but it wasn't very good. Poor texture and a sort of waxt taste. More important, there's something in it that feels like large grit. I can only imagine that it's the pears, cut a bit close to the core. I haven't picked it apart to see what it is, because I don't much care, and it puts me off of buying any more. (That's with milk.) So, not their best effort, I'm afraid. Somehow, I don't think it's going to be much of a success. The indulgence of chocolate sure doesn't go with the gritty texture of what else is in there. Probably the #5 is a better alternative if you want chocolate.	0	0

It has an awful chemical taste to it that is not likened to peanut butter in the least.  I did not try mixing it with anything, that may have helped, especially if what you mixed it with neutralized the taste!

-1	B003FDC2I2	A3NVUUYGCD4UXA	Did not like the vanilla bean...	I purchased both the vanilla bean and chocolate based on all the 5 star reviews, protein, organic, and nutritionally equivalent to 10 servings of fruits/veggies.  The chocolate was okay, but the vanilla bean had a strange after-taste....still not sure how to describe it - reminded me of cornbread and soybeans.  Adding frozen fruit and blending it helped a little, but didn't completely mask the weird after-taste.  Maybe it was a 'bad batch,' but the expiration date was March 2012, so I don't believe that was the probem.  Unfortunately, taste is a HUGE factor for me, so even though I like everything else about these shakes, I won't be buying again.	1	2

-1	B000GTJQN2	A2F5AHGE7T0DIW	Poor Customer Service/ Bad Food	I tried this food because reviews claim it is more natural and therefore more healthy for your dog, it also gives a satisfaction guarantee.  Well, the food made my dog sick! (caused puking, muscle spasms) So I clipped the proof of purchase and mailed in my receipt as the guarantee asked. I got a coupon in the mail for a small bag of food! For one, the coupon is for a smaller bag of food. Two, I requested a refund....why would I give the same food to my dog and make him sick? I called customer service and they said you can only get refunds from the retailer! Ok, now that you took my receipt how do I do that? The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee.	3	1

-1	B001D0IZ4O	A17SKMAS0YYBV	Not same taste as packets	"The packets of white hot chocolate powder mix have been discontinued by Timothy's (per their customer service) so I purchased the K-cups this time around from Amazon for the great quantity and price deal.  Well, let me tell you, the K-cup formula tastes like chemicals and has a lousy aftertaste. They are horrible. The label on the box of K-cups says there is sucralose in them whereas the packets did not have sucralose. I still had one packet left to compare labels with and that is the main difference. I called Timothy's customer service to ask why they changed the formula & did I get a box of ""sugar-free"" or ""diet"" K-cups in a regular box in error. I was informed this is just the way they're formulated.  So, I will never buy them again & will have to find someone to take these 2 boxes of nasty tasting things off my hands."	0	0
-1	B001RVFEP2	A23R4JI2Q9CKDR	Ok	I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to.

1	B000JUK4OS	A194BBLXC4BJCW	Not bad. Exactily as advertized.	I ordered these simply out of curiosity. All those rumors about space food people have been spreading around. First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours.	0	0

-1	B000EMPNCE	A3LHH530B23B4I	Didn't like it, Wrong one	"I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said ""Dark Chocolate"" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as ""Dark Hot"" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says ""Dark Chocolate"" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside."	1	2

-1	B006HYLW32	AE5AHEH3NLPBZ	Tastes Like Celery	I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.	0	0

-1	B007RTR9G0	A1I2U8NT5J6P1N	Great for the beach/Changed from 3 to 1 star	This is a very heavy oil product that should only be used by people that either have really dry kinky hair or really dry thick hair.<br /><br />I brought it to the beach this week and I loved the fact for this price point I could saturate my hair, cover it and not get the drying effect I usually feel from  being at the beach all day.  It is an excellent product for this type of use.<br /><br />This product has a very inexpensive price point (4.00 vs 8.00 for Organix hydrating Macadamia oil which I usually use)<br />This can only be used on very thick dry hair.<br />Great for beach use<br />Do not use on scalp.<br />And lastly I agree with the many comments that say they should have instructions on how to use.  That would clear up a lot of confusion.<br />Bottom line... Good value for your hair IF you have the proper hair type.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have used this numerous times at the beach and decided to use it to condition my hair after washing (after the beach)  Goodness dont put this on your hair dry or wet.  It is so oily that no matter what your hair type (frizzy or afro , it will just weigh it down)  After this I really wouldnt recommend this to anyone.	0	0
-1	B000WFPN82	AO72AZ8HK7I2I	Never received it	I received half of my order, this product was never received.

1	B002RMHZXE	A29M09QBG9TZLP	My 3 dogs LOVE IT!	We have 3 large breed dogs. Rocky, a 70lb Black and Tan coonhound, Nellie a 60lb Treeing Walker coonhound and finally the pickiest eater Buddy an 80lb Blue Heeler. Nellie and Buddy are very picky eaters. Rocky can be picky as well.<br /><br />All of my dogs will eat Gravy Train. I've fed my dogs Blue, Iams Naturals, Science Diet, Purina dog chow and numerous others trying to find one that they all will eat. Gravy Train is the only one! It seems Gravy Train really keeps their weight on them, kind of like a maintenience dog food. Once a day I mix in 1/3 of a can of the wet Gravy Train with their food and they always clean their bowls. The only other dog food they've liked as much is the Eukanuba Naturals Turkey and that is expensive and hard to find locally in my area.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend for any dogs. Though, the kibble is on the larger size, so if you have a very small dog, you might want to get a smaller kibbled dog food. Otherwise fantastic!	0	0
-1	B0098C6AKK	A3JLECMNWC4LDY	It's Terrible.	Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).	0	1
1	B007TGDXMK	A19NMTN66EKHM1	Best and Cheapest K-Cup Option I've Found	These k-cups are cheap because they don't have the plastic cup base. That means that they don't keep as long, but frankly I haven't had an issue with that. They are delivered in 12-pack bags with most of the air pushed out of a valve. I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds.	1	0
-1	B000BZZKVS	A26T5Y5XBVS1VD	Hardly tolerable	I ordered this based on others reviews that it tasted great. I force myself to use it prior to a run and can force down one during the run but the flavor is not good. Texture is fine and I think the caffeine is great however a terrible flavor.	0	0
1	B000DZFMEQ	A3RQJCTD2MMKEB	My daily bread	After figuring out that I was gluten intolerant about 3 years ago, I tried a bunch of breads (mostly frozen) available in specialty grocery stores, and a couple from dedicated GF bakeries, but didn't really like any of them.  I made my own GF bread for a while, using a Bette Hagman (Gluten Free Gourmet) recipe, and that was good, but quite time consuming.  Once my baby was born and I had no time to bake bread from scratch, I discovered Pamela's GF bread mix.  It's very easy to throw it in the bread machine, and it comes out great.  The house smells good, the bread is fairly soft, and it keeps longer on the shelf than the bread I used to bake.  (I still usually freeze 1/3 of each loaf, because it does start getting stale after several days.)  Now, I usually add 1/4 cup of flax seed meal and 2 T water to the mix for Omega-3s.	1	0
1	B003GTR8IO	AK7CAW3N1XZV6	Decent-tasting coffee with subtle vanilla flavor	Although Starbucks isn't my favorite brand of coffee to use at home (that distinction goes to Godiva Breakfast Blend), I do like experimenting with different flavored coffees, and so I was interested in trying this new offering from Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee itself is reminiscent of a light-to-medium roast.  The vanilla flavor is a nice addition, but it is VERY subtle.  I made this coffee in both my drip coffee maker and my french press, and surprisingly, I found that the vanilla was more detectable in the former (usually the french press provides a more pronounced flavor).  There was a decent vanilla aroma to the coffee as well--not enough to fill the house, but noticeable in the individual mug.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would recommend this coffee to those who enjoy the Starbucks brand and prefer flavorings that do not overpower the overall coffee taste.	1	0

-1	B000ELWDRI	A2S39VLOVSTOJS	OK for storm food	"As we all know.....any canned soup, organic or not, should be avoided or at least limited.  It does work for storm supplies due to its easy medium term storage and it being infrequently or never used.  It will end up in a hunting camp for a few days of quick meals toward the end of its shelf life.  Everything tastes better in fresh air and this stuff isn't bad.  Again, its use is very limited.<br /><br />Don't like the BPA issue either.  I did speak to Wolfgang Puck about PBA and their plans.  Like most, they are treading water to see what the government (friends of the fda) does or does not do about it.  What's a little more poison added to the current mix in processed foods.<br /><br />Ever notice that most of the Wolfgang Puck soup ingredients here on Amazon end at ""Contains 2% or less of the Following""........?<br /><br />As I indicated above, we did try this soup, and it tasted ok, nothing special.  Try adding a little more sea salt. It is better than the MSG enhanced, preservative laden Campbell's brand crap, a brand we would not buy regardless of circumstance.  One never knows who actually made this soup.<br /><br />We consider the organic versions the lesser of (insert remaining cliche), and have a case......in case."	1	0

No Joke. i actually like this tea..i'm not exactly a tea drinker, but i drink it at least one thing of tea a day..mainly cause of the benifits long and short term. I'm not as lazy as i used to be, n i just feel 100% more ALIVE lol..yea i'm kinda being overdramatic, but i can't get enough. i learned a lot about this stuff from my health class in college. the blend of GREEN and WHITE tea is AMAZING FOR YOUR HEALTH!! if u googled the benifits of green and/or white tea u'd definitely wanna get some of this stuff for urself! ;P	0	0

1	B001HTKOWC	A281NPSIMI1C2R	Mildly Minty	Some mint teas are overwhelming but Stash's Morocan Mint is just mildly minty. It is made with spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint and green tea. I don't really taste anything too lemony. This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey. If you don't think this is strong enough use two tea bags like I do.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	0	0

-1	B006N3I29E	A17JKM8OGSMQAJ	Good Blend, but roast was too light.	I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.

-1	B0016PC4TS	A3T4OHEAHOJ700	More Like Critter Pepper	"This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:<br /><br />#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.<br />#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.<br />#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.<br /><br />The other 99.3% are ""other ingredients"".<br /><br />When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.<br /><br />I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.<br /><br />While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.<br /><br />I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.<br /><br />But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.<br /><br />For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product."	0	0
1	B001KWVJ5C	A2N1EQWZ1Z4IMM	Amazing	I have been buying this for a year now. It needs added salt - which is GREAT because you control. Most fast Indian foods for the home are simply loaded with sodium. I add a bit of red pepper sometimes. But, really, other than some sea salt, this stuff needs nothing to make a fast tasty dish.	0	0

-1	B005K4Q37A	A11PM0C1979EZA	Plastic taste	This is the first coffee I tried when I got my Keurig.  I was so disappointed in the flavor; tasted like plastic (like drinking bottled water that was left in a hot car).  I thought maybe I hadn't cleaned the Keurig enough so I put through more water and brewed another cup...same horrible taste.  I would not recommend this brand to anyone.	3	1
-1	B005MWAM72	AF3X7J0XC391L	Not superior to the competing brands	The maple and brown sugar combination seems about the right balance for the two but the amount overall covers the oat flavor.  Perhaps it is my personal preference for very little sugar but overall I was disappointed.  With many flavors of instant oats, the Quaker oats are far superior to the competition.  I am not able to detect a great difference in this flavor from many of the cheap store-brand varieties I have tried.  It is acceptable for an occasional variety in breakfast but nothing that sets it apart from others.	0	0

-1	B000GW23PC	A1G8USRY17IR1X	OK, but could be a lot better	"I have tried the Jack Links Jerkey chew a few times, mainly as a way to have a little flavor in my mouth while working in hot/dusty conditions. This seems to be the only brand you can find stocked on convenience store shelves.<br /><br />In terms of the flavor, the ""Original"" is pretty mild. As noted by a previous reviewer, I also found the can didn't seem to have much in it. However, it only takes a small pinch at a time. For me, I thought it was a little too much on the dry/powdery side. Realistically, it's probably the ""ground up"" pieces that probably fall to the side when they are packaging their regular jerkey. It does highly resemble the ""genuine"" bacon bits that you buy at the grocery.<br /><br />For what it was, it was OK. I would like to see it a little more ""shredded"", so it packs better, and a little less ground up (like coffee grounds). I'd also like to see it a bit more moist, so it would pack better. As it stands, you have to be careful opening the can in a strong wind, or you might lose half of it. Finally, I think it would be interesting if they had a mildly nicotine-infused version, but that would restrict over-the-counter sales and bring on a whole new level of rules. Otherwise, I don't see where it would really help someone get over a dipping habit.<br /><br />One reviewer noted that this could easily be considered a ""gateway"" path for children to using real tobacco. To that, I would agree on some levels. Much like ""Big League Chew"" resembles a pouch of chewing tobacco, or ""cancy cigarettes"" resembles a real smoke. The important thing, if you are allowing your child to ""eat"" this, is that you convey the dangers of tobacco use and make clear that this is not the same thing. The packaging does not ""make"" the product something else."	1	1
-1	B0052OUAOK	A13KHI453YCB4T	This product contains sugar.	I ordered this product based on the information that it was sweetened with dates and honey. Raw Cane syrup was not mentioned as an ingredient. Unfortunately, they neglected to state that the Chocolate covering is sweetened with Raw Cane Syrup, i.e. sugar. I am very careful to avoid cane sugar and so, was disappointed that the ingredient list was incomplete. I rated it one star, because it was not as advertised.	0	3

-1	B001FA1KLW	AIX0Q5GBVTOD4	"RESPONSE TO ""B. DAVIS"" ON METAL FACTOR"	"Well, now I'm totally confused.  Thought these totally eliminated the metal factor in cans [aside from the waste factor as well after opening].  I naturally assumed that the tubes were all plastic as many tubes are for other things, and that's why it survives in the fridge.  Where do you store the rest of the tubes before using, before opening.  Is it safe to be even IN the metal before open as CANS are not after an expiration date?  This is a lot of money to spend all at once on tomato paste not knowing if even ""IT"" will go bad.  Rachael Ray's and other cooks buy their supplies almost daily, not in `bulk' so that's fine for them but not for me, I always buy in bulk, not shopping often.  Another suggestion is to flatten out the paste in a zip lock bag, freeze, then break off portions as used, being thin enough it's easy, OR freeze portions in ice cube tray then put into zip locks when totally frozen, or on any surface temporarily also putting into zips when frozen.  But that also can be a pain, having to do that all the time.  Seriously considering whether to get these, especially knowing they're metal tubes or even lined with metal.  Can't find in any stores in NYC and getting very frustrated for a long time since I don't travel around to markets.  I have many little cans of Paste always but think, ""ahhh, why open one just for this"" or for that and getting fed up not using them.  Just threw out another remainder of 8 oz. can which I thought I'd use soon, but didn't and forgot about, in fridge otherwise I would have put the whole thing [in an empty marjorine cup] into the freezer for when I `felt' like making portions but forgot, therefore another almost full can into the trash.  Enough already with the cans.  It's 2010 and they should be more readily available, but guess the manufacturers love this 'can' game to induce more waste, therefore more sales.  Thought the tubes were the answer, but now this makes me wonder about the metal in the tubes as well.  I don't use things up that quickly for even the tubes to go fast,  but thought they were at least safe."	2	19

1	B003D4F1QS	A8M2FBCHS9IST	Yum-o! 5+ cups of this tea a day!	I first fell in love with Stash's Wild Raspberry Herbal Tea on a recent trip to San Francisco. The little, european style hotel I stayed in offered this yummy tea 24-7 and I found myself stopping to grab a cup at least 3x a day. The tea has a strong, raspberry fruit flavor that is crisp enough to please your tongue and keep you hydrated, but without the keep-you-up-all-night caffeine. I instantly began craving the flavor.<br /><br />When I flew back to the east coast I was sad to realize that I couldn't find it in my local grocery store. I quickly hopped on Amazon and was happy to find that I can have the tea shipped to me. (YEA! Amazon!). Buying in the 100-count boxes is the cheapest option I've found, however, be warned that the 100-count box delivers the tea bags loose (they're in their separate, pink tea pouches, but loose in the box), which can be a cabinet disaster if you do not have a tea box or other place to keep the 100 tea bags under rule.<br /><br />The tea is great hot or cold over ice... you absolutely can't go wrong with this fruity tea!	0	0

-1	B003R0LKSG	A1NUGHVW06D9AA	CAT PUKED after eating this runny slop	"This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!<br /><br />She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><br />Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.<br /><br />Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here's the good stuff: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0"">Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />(Did they really want me to post a video with this review?

-1	B001VJ0B0I	A2LAS014NSRW72	Nothing special...dogs weren't impressed	"How do you review a dog food that you aren't even going to taste yourself?  Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina (this product), Chef Michael's Sirloin (fancy stuff), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).<br /><br />Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but Chef Michael got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the Beneful or others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give up the CM.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  The Beneful was the most colorful and interesting ""looking"", but it didn't make them appear interested. Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.<br /><br />As far as the next day, there was leftover Beneful, so the blue jays that look for freebies were checking it out. They liked it.  I don't think it's a bad dog food, but given the options, they were just not interested in Beneful (although I like the commercials!).<br /><br />One thing that bugged me (slightly) was that I was told that both corn and oatmeal make dogs coats itch...not sure if that's true, but Beneful seems to make a big deal out of their veggie ingredients.  Dogs are carnivores.  I couldn't help but think maybe the bag and advertising was intended to impress people with the ingredients, rather than the dogs.  They've been eating this since the Chef Michael ran out, and I didn't notice any itching, and I also didn't notice too much doggy doo-doo, which often is excessive with cheap dog food.  So I would think it's a quality product, just not in comparison.<br /><br />An unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online, if it's Prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free...so no lugging it from the store.  I like that convenience of that, and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on Amazon so that I don't have to run out when when we frequently run out."	0	1

-1	B006MONQMC	A1WXG10FJ353K0	Be prepared to wear it!	Oh heck no, not happy at all.  I have used the similar MIO water enhancers, and enjoy them.  They are only 1.6 oz bottles, and this is 12 ounces.  Obviously you need to shake this, then though for some reason they want you to store it upside down, you turn it up and flip open the cap.  On my first attempt, the bright red liquid shot out freely, spilled all over the place and stained everything it touched, including my now ruined shirt.  I wiped it off the floor, counter and walls, cleaned, and then took the closed bottle and washed it under water.  I blamed it on user error, and was more cautious on my next attempt. But, before you even turn it over it starts coming out.  Dare to actually squeeze it, you get too much, and some of it might end up in the glass if you're lucky.<br /><br />So, once you are out of energy after cleaning the mess, once again, you take a sip and now can't describe what you are drinking.  It just tastes like plastic to me.  Reading the ingredients, I have no idea what is causing the plastic taste, so it must be the plastic bottle.  The taste is eventually tolerable, but not so much.  The MIO bottle is ten times smaller and lasts longer, with better taste.  But honestly, this is the stupidest bottle I have ever seen.  Do not store on it's lid as it will spill all over your fridge. I have it upright in a can holder. If you have kids, forget it. You will be cleaning this up endlessly.	1	1
1	B000KSTYBS	A1SI2993YY7C61	mmm...	Without a doubt, this is the smoothest whole bean coffee I've ever tasted. I don't know what biodynamic means, but it's delicious!<br /><br />For a French roast, it's not that bold. I use a Mr Coffee grinder (which I've reviewed in the past) and a Melitta single-serving drip cone. It's a basic setup. But everyone who's tried it RAVES about it. Even the cream&sugar crowd can drink this black. This is the perfect coffee to get non-coffee drinkers hooked. It tastes almost as good as it smells.<br /><br />The beans have an oily sheen. I don't know if that's some sort of edible sealant to keep the volatile flavor oils from wafting away, or if the beans are so full of flavor it's exuding from the surface. Either way, this is a winner.<br /><br />I haven't subscribed yet because I'd like to try the other Cafe Altura products before I commit to just one, but this  one's certainly at the top of my list. I've ordered this one 4x already.<br /><br />I've noticed this thing has gotten pricier since the first time I bought it. I got two 32oz bags the first time appeared on Amazon. That's okay though. It's still cheaper than Trader Joe's and definitely tastier.	0	0

I don't mean to sound like a broken record about my recent Crystal Light Moctail reviews, but...<br />This Appletini just *isn't*. Once you get it in your mind that hey, it reminds you of Jolly Ranchers, then that is all you'll think about as you sip it. Which makes it taste gross, the thought of liquid Jolly Ranchers in your glass. (Yes it also has the aspartame aftertaste...) Like the Margarita, it seemed to be quickly overwhelmed with the ice and would probably have held up better if using two pouches for the 2 quarts instead of one.<br /><br />None of us liked this, not even a little bit. The smell was a little gagful. It's not a flavor that I could consider mixing with something else to make it taste good. (That's pretty bad!) One plus, it's so green that you could probably foist it off on Trick-Or-Treaters in October, as ""Witch Brew""!"	1	2
-1	B009GHI5Q4	A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW	Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more	"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."	6	8

-1	B001PUFBLM	A2IY3OHMUJ1EPV	received wrong item twice	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PUFBLM"">9GreenBox - Adenium Desert ROSE Sparkle Star House Plant Bonsai</a><br /><br />Dear Sir:<br />After ordering a white desert rose on April 9th, 2012, I received a pink flowering plant. After complaining, I was told either to get a replacement or refund. I asked for a replacement, after two weeks I e-mailed for the status of my replacement and was told it was shipped long ago. After communicating back and forth four times, I was told a new one was shipped again, again no plant. Again I was told that I would receive another within three days, again no plant. I e-mailed again asking for shipment confirmation and no response.  Finaly on June 30th a received my replacement. It's great to finally receive a new replacement but yesterday I looked at the plant and new flowering buds seem to be developing. But again, the buds are pink and not the white plant that I originally ordered. Seem that 9GreenBox is a very dishonest plant company that does not ship what they advertise and it takes a long time to get a new one. After all my complaints not receiving the right one, it happens for the second time. Most companies would not make the same mistake twice. I request that you refund my money with shipping cost as soon as possible. Please let me know on what to do with your two pink plants. My recomendation to other desert rose buyers buy from a reputable plant company.<br /><br />Dennis"	1	0

-1	B0009F3POO	A3Q775NGC0MHCF	Great results, but slight allergic reaction	The throat coat tea worked wonders for my seasonal congestion! The taste was a little off-putting, but it wasn't horrible.<br /><br />I was hoping to add this to my morning breakfast menu, but I noticed that I developed a rash of fine raised bumps on my neck after drinking this tea for three days. After reading the ingredients of the tea, the only ingredient that I've never used before is the slippery elm bark. Web MD states that slippery elm bark can cause allergic reactions and skin irritation, so this ingredient is the cause. I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't take a genius to make the connection here. I've stopped using the tea, and my rash has magically disappeared.<br /><br />Judging by all the five star reviews on this product, it's obvious that it works for a lot of people, but first time users of this product should be cautious when buying it for the first time.	0	0
1	B000X1Q1G8	A3IJUJ5OIZ7Q3Y	A Good PB Substitute for Special Diets	Please note that his is not peanut butter; it is peanut flavored spread. The consistency is that of a peanut butter flavored ice cream topping.  Of course the consistency and taste are not just like peanut butter, which is loaded with fat and calories. If you have special diet needs and cannot have peanut butter, this is a decent peanutty tasting substitute. I used to consume peanut butter every day without fail. When I had to remove it from diet over a year ago it was very difficult.  This product really helps to fill the PB craving.	1	0

-1	B004FGWU9O	A25SQ33WVST1HV	Not a fan of this blend	"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands."	0	1

1	B005QRPHPU	A5K3CK2PWYQ7O	Good treat, but pricey	My dogs love chewy treats and these seemed like a good possible option to combine a safe and healthy treat with the opportunity to chew.  On the positive side, there was no excess packaging, the treats arelow calorie, gluten free  and safe/healthy for your dog if given in the recommended amounts and even for dogs on strict diets.  There's a nice cinnamon smell that's appealing to humans.  Both my dogs appeared to enjoy this treat and were eager for a second once they ate the first, so in addition to the positive aspects for a cautious owner, it was also popular with the intended audience.<br /><br />However, I'd also caveat this with a few other issues.  First, the package says a medium dog could get 2 sticks per day.  There are six sticks in a bag and the cost is $6 - that's fairly pricey given that my dogs (admittedly expert, hardy chewers) ate their sticks in less than 5 minutes.  While the cinnamon scent is appealing to humans, one of my dogs didn't seem excited about it at first.  She did decide to eat it after a couple minutes (she initially put it down and backed away), but only because the other dog expressed interest.  Once she ate the first one, she seemed more than willing to take another, but there was an initial hesitation.  I'd expected something that might take longer to chew through.  I'm the first to admit my dogs are super-chewers, so if your dog doesn't have jaws of steel, you might get more out of this treat, but it took between 2 -4 minutes (depending on which of the dogs) to eat the strips.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind the price, it's not a bad treat.	0	0
1	B000FI61OQ	A350S0ZK3M9OTC	tasty lettuce	My husband loves having salad greens so I thought he would be pleased when I bought this. However, at first glance he thought it wasn't going to produce enough lettuce for the huge salads he likes to eat and he said he wished I had bought herbs instead like we did last time. So far we've harvested twice and the taste of the lettuce has been lovely. The first harvest was small, enough to decorate the side of two plates. The second salad was much larger, enough for two American style side salad plates. The chef pack comes with enough pods to grow an Aerogarden full of lettuce twice. I pulled off some lettuce for a sandwich once, and that seems like a good use of this thing (concerning the volume issue).	0	0

1	B001J3ZUQ6	A3GXKA5UKW72C7	Good Popcorn even in a hot air popper	"Please take the numbers in this review with a pinch of salt (and maybe a little butter).<br /><br />My pack came today.  The directions said that a serving was 3 tablespoons, so I took one tablespoon of each of the three varieties and put them in my (very old) hot air popper and turned it on.  It popped fine with only a few un-popped kernels  and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small -- perhaps 1/3 of the number that I get with ""regular"" popcorn.  The popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped, but the that's to be expected since they are about 1/2 the size when it starts out.  The flavor of all three varieties is good and I could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste.  I could not distinguish between the three varieties visually (but I didn't do a careful inspection, I just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as I was putting it in my mouth.  I used about half a tablespoon of melted (real) butter and a decent size pinch of salt.  I thought the three tablespoon serving was reasonable, perhaps not as much as I usually eat by volume but probably slightly more than I usually eat in terms of number of kernels.  I'll try some tomorrow popped in oil and post an edit to this review.<br /><br />In summary, it's a touch pricy for popcorn, but the flavor is slightly different from grocery store  popcorn and I'd buy it again (especially with free (Prime) shipping)."	1	0

-1	B003ZJ397O	A2QVAU3YMOELU7	Charming package, mixed quality tea	Tea forte design is very delightful: the slender pyramidal tea bag with the pert little green leaf decoration makes that morning cup extra special. I only wish that they would have put as much thought perfecting into their actual teas. The basic black teas (darjeeling, breakfast, etc.) are nice, but the herbal and green teas have an odd artificial flavoring -- like drinking potpourri. The strange aftertaste makes it seem as if they add artificial sugars like sweet and low. I prefer my teas pure usually and also think it's better practice in general to let the tea-drinker decide how much sugar and what kind.	12	1

Overall, I like the smaller packaging and that it uses ingredients that I can read and understand.	1	0

-1	B004CYLW7A	A3MLKJ1HHA2SX0	Honey Nut Cheerios Want-to-Be	"I had high hopes for this cereal, as I am a big peanut fan.  However, while the cereal itself is ""not bad"" it's lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First and foremost it's not made with whole grains like Honey Nut Cheerios is.  Another reviewer put it nicely when they said this is equivalent to eating candy for breakfast.  The amount of sugar and refined carbohydrates is way too much for any type of health benefit whatsoever.  The peanuts are so small and in such small pieces (more like granules) that I don't consider them anywhere near enough to consider any health benefits from the nuts.<br /><br />The taste itself is good, and it's a bit softer of a crunch than most cereals, but outside of that it's just too many carbohydrates to be on the breakfast table.  Kellog's could really improve this cereal by getting rid of some of the added sweetners and switch to a whole grain recipe.  Until then, if you like sweet cereals with little health benefits then this is for you -- but otherwise, stick with Honey Nut Cheerios."	0	0
-1	B002TOEMWW	A2VAUBMREGHKPS	Niether a ChickenStrip  nor a Chicken Jerky ( or Duck Jerky)	This product is more of a crumbly cookie.  My beagle ate it for a few days and then refused them.  I thought that his digestive system was a bit disrupted by this product, as well.  Of course, I cannot say for sure that these treats were the cause of his upset...perhaps my beagle can.  Anyhow, I will not be repeating this order.	0	0

1	B000084DVR	A3DKGXWUEP1AI2	Premium Quality Dog Food!!!	We have been using this food for about 6 months now and find it to be just excellent! Other than the fact our two dogs (a Coton de Tulear 15lbs, and Standard Poodle puppy 40lbs) both love the food, but are thriving.  Their coats are in excellent condition and their overall structure is perfect.  Good tasting to the dog and good for them and a good deal for the owner.  All around the best food we have ever used.  Excellent!!!	3	0

1	B001EQ55RW	A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ	Emerald - Cocoa Roast Alomonds, Net Wt. 11 ounces	Delicious snack that's easily addictive. I like this flavor just as much as the other two Emerald cannister of almonds I've tried recently. Has a most distinctive dark chocolate almond flavor. I've seen this item in the grocery  store for $2.99 and sometimes slightly higher. Appears to have the chocolate powder sprinkled and baked onto the almond - so there's no mess. Great to sneak in under your jacket when catching a movie at the neighborhood theater.	1	0

-1	B003GTR8IO	A2T1TIT8QKEB5C	No flavor	Purchased this coffee because I enjoy vanilla and coffee, and enjoyed a previously purchased bag of Starbucks ground coffee. It sounded good, but I was wrong.

1	B002QWP89S	APNLFE7D7ZQZA	Our dogs' favorite!	When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed.	0	0
-1	B003YBLF2E	A3EFSLEMHNPP6A	Overpriced indeed	As some others have noted, the GoPicnic salmon is like overpriced catfood.  Heck, I've seen Fancy Feast cat food appetizers provide a higher quality of flaky salmon than you'll find in this GoPicnic snackbox.<br /><br />First, the good.  The edamame dried soybeans provide 30% of your daily protein intake, which was quite surprising to me.  They were slightly on the bland side however, but I felt very nutritious when consuming then.  The chocolate square and trail mix were ok (not great, but passable), and tasted fine.  Also, the Sudoku game on the bottom of the packaging was a thoughtful touch, although I don't play Sudoku.  Also, the crackers were pretty tasty; reminded me of a healthier version of Ritz crackers.<br /><br />Now, the bad.  The salmon, which is supposed to be the centerpiece of the meal, was nasty.  Didn't taste like salmon at all, since it was overpowered by other spices, but it did have a slightly fishy odor.  Had an odd consistency, probably better suited to coming out of a bottle of toothpaste.<br /><br />I guess the GoPicnic isn't a terrible choice if you were starving and it were given to you for free.  But even if I were starving, I probably wouldn't eat the salmon.	0	2

-1	B001FSK4N4	A3RR2P5IS3DGPR	I couldn't swallow it - had to spit it out	"I LOVE Conte's Florentine Pizza; it is my favorite pizza.  So eventhough I couldn't swallow their lasagna, I thought I would try another one of their products.  I purchased one bag of Conte's Gluten Free Spinach/Cheese Ravioli for $8.99 at Whole Foods and made a fresh basil pesto to serve on it.  I ended up eating the pesto and throwing out the ravioli.  The pasta has really a disgusting taste and really the thought that comes to my mind is this tastes like somebody else already spit it out.  So then I decided to try removing the pasta and just eating the inside of the pasta which that was swallable with a bunch of pesto on it.  If you are listening Conte's, my vote is for you to develop more varieties of pizza and stay away from the pasta as it is nasty.  So the cooked pastas are in the garbage disposal and the rest of the bag of frozen pastas is now in my garage garbage.  I do, however, whole-heartedly recommend my favorite GF pasta <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTZ96"">Mrs. Leeper's Pasta Organic, Rice Vegetable Twists, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"	0	0

I'm one of three furry beings that share a dwelling with our friend Two Legs, and the food that is usually served is gross. Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!<br /><br />Two Legs is opening up something new!<br />It smells wonderful. Enticing.<br />Looks good too.<br />WOW. What a flavor.<br />Tuna and Shrimp. Tuna and Sole! Yellowfin! And the Snapper is the cat's pajamas.<br />I'm in heaven.<br />Thank you Two Legs.

1	B000FK63IS	A2ZF652T71JKBX	I am VERY Picky About Texture	"I have heightened sensitivity to touch/texture. It can make enjoying food a little difficult sometimes unless the texture is JUST RIGHT.<br /><br />And this pasta, in my opinion, is great.<br /><br />I cooked it according to the energy-saver directions (where you boil water, place noodles in, cook for a couple minutes and then turn OFF stove, cover and let sit for 20 minutes). The package says it can withstand a lot of overcooking, but they were a TAD mushy when made this way. They were still VERY tasty, despite being a tiny bit too soft. (I would have subtracted 1/2 star for this, but since we can't do that I decided it was still worth the 5 stars)<br /><br />It had a nice flavor too. Slightly sweet and mild, it's best when you salt the water- it balances this out nicely. The price may seem expensive to some, but my husband is very picky about pasta and usually wants us to buy a certain brand that is just about the same price as this stuff- so it's not much of a difference for us.<br /><br />MOST importantly, after eating a fair amount, I did NOT feel ""bloaty"" like I usually do after eating wheat pasta. I felt very satisfied without feeling overfull.<br /><br />I don't know, my husband is one of the pickiest eaters when it comes to pasta and even HE liked it.<br /><br />I think next time I will just cook it a little less. Will definitely be getting this on a regular basis now."	2	0
-1	B000CQ6KTM	A3CVZ9PLYOVN5V	Just doesn't taste very good.	I wanted this to be even moderately tasty so that my 3-yr-old would eat it. He's picky, and Kraft Mac and Cheese is something I can always get him to eat - but hate that it's so highly processed and non-organic. Quite frankly, Amy's just doesn't taste very good. It's bitter, the cheese is thin (and I got rid of the water in the shells).<br /><br />I still give it three stars because of Amy's business practices which I love - but won't buy again.	1	2

1	B001AWFJO4	A3DRM0GO78MZ48	delicious-my kitties told me so	not really sure how i can review a product i can't taste, so i'll go by my cats reaction to this. i have 2 good eaters and one fusspot!. well, now miss fusspot jumps on the counter while i'm opening the cans and i have to feed her first! she has turned into a total pig!. i'm hooked on the stuff. I order several different flavors to give them some variety. I will also say that when I adopted my fatty 21 pounder, i tried for years to get him to lose weight. Recently the vet told me he lost 5 pounds! (that's like 50 pounds in humans) and I will honestly say the pounds didn't come off until I started feeding him this stuff. I gave him high quality dry food, pure tuna (pet food) from TJs and nothing worked. until this.<br />And the price is right! I'm hooked.<br /><br />update: i still buy tiki cat for my furkids b/c it's better than supermarket brand. But the fatty 21 pounder lost weight (10 pounds total) because he has an overactive thyroid. I didn't find this out until recently and don't want to mislead anyone. So now he is on special pills, and oh yeah, prescription kidney food for him (he is older and kidney probs are common in older cats). The other two still devour this stuff, and when (formerly fat) kitty can sneak, he grabs from his sisters.	2	0

When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.

1	B00317Y3HK	A2ZUPPUAG99J1O	Good food for sensitive dog	I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.	0	0

-1	B0081XPTBS	A1P6KS6PDIO743	Doesn't taste great	I can't recommend this formula.  Prior to trying it, my baby had been consuming breast milk and enfamil formula, each from a bottle, and had always seemed to enjoy both.  When I fed him Earth's Best, he made a sad, surprised face immediately, but soldiered on with the feeding, only to throw it almost all up at the end of the feeding.  I've never felt like I had so failed my baby.  After that, I taste tested Earth's Best, Enfamil and my own breast milk (too much information?).  The latter two were tasty, and quite similar to each other (with a sweetness to them).  When it came to Earth's Best, I had to agree with my baby--it tasted bad, with almost a metallic flavor to it.  I'll never subject him to it again.	0	2
-1	B000EH2QPQ	AD2VQ68K0LIS5	excellent ingredients but my dogs don't like it much	I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.	0	0
-1	B000VPWWIC	A2NY8YRUTRWB0Y	Eat at Your Own Risk...	Too risky for me, so I never ate this stuff and threw it out. Lesson learned: if the ingredients are not listed here on Amazon, check another website for the ingredients BEFORE buying the product.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Corn syrup, sugar, cream, coconut and other natural flavors, carrageenan, propylene glyrol, alginate, soy lecithin, vanilla, white food coloring (titanium dioxide), salt, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum. Processed in a facility that uses nuts. Keep refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because the product did arrive quick.	0	0

1	B007M83302	A1V7889Z1SVIVY	Best chips ever?  Probably!	"SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big ""retail box"" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good."	0	0
-1	B000E1ZUQY	AJGVGCIRVAY4F	Robin C	I ordered this item, and I ended up wasting $12.00 because they were terrible. Very bland, and tasted stale.<br /><br />I would never order any other products from Kay's natural line.	1	1

1	B001EQ55ZO	A189BPUDLRCQEQ	Tasty and packs a peppery punch	"Having always loved cashews, even though they aren't exactly a low-calorie snack, I was looking forward to tasting this product. Nor was I disappointed, but I was surprised. The description promises sea salt with ""a hint"" of pepper. Well, it's a rather big hint. The pepper provides a shock to the taste buds with these cashews. Partly because one expects salt but not pepper with cashews, and partly because, as I stated above, the pepper is a bit thicker than you might expect. And it's somewhat tangy pepper, too. I like spicy, tangy foods so this is not a problem for me. After a couple of handfuls I had to force myself to stop before I wolfed down the whole can. I like them and I'll buy more. But do be aware that, if you like your food--especially your cashews--on the mild side, the tangy pepper here may be overwhelming. It's pretty bold, and my only caveat is, again, the pepper is more than a hint's worth."	0	0

-1	B000FK52B2	A32EHNK1TVFA8L	Sprout Master	The biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems  to be much easier with a jar and screens. However, the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time.	14	0
-1	B001E18K8S	AYNIT5FYOCH30	Wish I could take this	I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night, and I have suffered from migraines for most of my life. This product seemed like the perfect solution to both problems.<br /><br />For the sleep issue, I have never found anything that even comes close. I actually fell asleep, shortly after going to bed, with ease. This was really an incredible change for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I discovered that my migraines got worse when I was taking this. Not just a little bit worse, MUCH worse. It was as if the worst part of the migraine got extended much longer than normal. It was to the point that I had to be driven home from work and ended up in the ER in one case while I was taking this (the normal dose recommended on the label). This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them. So, hopefully this reaction is fairly individual to me. But the lack of much of any negative reviews for this product compelled me to write a review. Evidently, not everybody reacts well to it (but I do really, really wish I could take it for the sleep benefit.)	7	0

I'm used to eating Sunsweet prunes, and they're sweeter and softer than these organic ones.<br /><br />I like that these are not so sweet, but sometimes I find them a bit tough, and I wish I weren't eating them straight from the bag but instead cooking them with oatmeal or something like that.<br /><br />I don't use them for any real physical problem or challenge; I've always really liked prunes in general. My dad needs these for regularity, and I must say they've been really good for him. Better than the generic or Sunsweet ones we used to get for him. Dunno why that is, but it is.<br /><br />Anyway--solid four-star rating.<br /><br />Ooo, little tip--put a few in a food processor and mince them up, then use them as a spread on toasted whole wheat or whole grain bread. Yummy!"	8	0

-1	B001E530A2	A3FUB3Q6AXG13U	Deceptive little buggers	I opened the snack cabinet in the office today and found something new: Sun Maid Vanilla Yogurt Raisins. I thought they might be a moderately healthy supplement to my boring lunch, so I opened a box and popped a few in my mouth.  The raisins were plumper than the normal desiccated Sun Maid product, but the yogurt coating was sweet but not distinctive tasting and had a weirdly slick texture after being chewed a couple times. Noting this, I idly checked the ingredients while I waited for my tea to warm up in the microwave. Natural California Raisins, check. Yogurt coating... with partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil. Hmm. The obverse of the box yielded the devilish Nutrition Fact I was looking for: One box of these demons contains 4 grams of saturated fat, or 20% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />These things are moderately tasty, but for that amount of saturated fat, I want to cram something absolutely delicious in my cake hole (like cake?). I would not recommend these to anyone, and I would definitely never give them to my children thinking they were some kind of healthy snack.	11	3

-1	B004H4NC4Q	A3QNQQKJTL76H0	Not crazy about this flavor	I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.<br /><br />In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.<br /><br />The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages. (The cap screws on.) Brewed and bottled in Chicago. I won't be buying this flavor again.	0	0

Make sure you have gophers first.  Gopher tunnels are off to the sides of the mounds (not in the centers).  Tie a rope to the end because the gophers try to drag themselves deeper into their graves.

-1	B003X0VOW2	AVWXRSHL5KSKR	Open Bottles in Huge Box	I ordered these ketchup bottles, some cereal, and some Pop-Tarts for my kids, even though there was already a 1 star review that said that the bottles were not sealed.  I thought that maybe it was a one-time issue.  A huge box arrived today with all 3 items in it, and the ketchup bottles had rattled around the box, smashing into everything else, and leaking all over the place.<br /><br />I tried to wash off the bottles, but then began to wonder which bottle it was that had leaked.  The answer?  There is no way to tell, as there were NO seals on ANY of the bottles.  They all arrived unsealed.<br /><br />If you don't mind about having bottles with no seal, and choose to order them anyway, my advice is to only order the ketchup, and wait a few days before ordering any other foodstuffs.  Otherwise, you, too, may find that the ketchup is all over, and that anything else you've bought has been hammered in its travels by the out of control ketchup.<br /><br />It also didn't help that, by packaging all these things together, the box was so heavy that my son had to help me into the house with it.	2	0

-1	B002QWP89S	A22JW7FCT9ASWE	Be careful with wheat gluten	"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."	24	23

1	B001E5E0Y2	A3NE9M7KTHN05F	wonderful product for a wonderful price	As long as you get this pack of 2 for the price of about $25 plus free shipping, it's a killer deal! Even if they were $30 I'd still buy them. The chocolate powder can be used as expected...just blend in your smoothies or use in baking/desserts. A little goes a long way--just a spoonful is enough for me each morning. It's very energizing and may be a little too overwhelming due to the caffeine content in it, but if you take it in moderation (or even combine it with some Maca Root powder, an anti-caffeine superfood) you should be fine.	2	0

Once you clean it once, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the seal back such that water does not leak out, making it impossible to steam or puree. I have another food processor (Cuisinart) that works fantastically well and I have used for four years without a problem. This is a problem with Beaba construction. I am pursuing a warranty refund. There is nothing on the website nor manual to help you anticipate this. The manual is written in multiple languages but only the inane, obvious instructions are written out. The only assembly instructions are a fuzzy drawing with arrows that say ""Clic!""<br /><br />I am thoroughly frustrated and disappointed.

1	B007XXLWHW	A12L1NY994GXSF	Milk Bone Trail Mix	My maltipoo named Elvis Lee just absolutely loves this trail mix!!  It provides him with a variety of treats in one bag!  The beef treats and the sweet potato are among his favorites and he also loves the flavored milk bones as well.  The ingredients are all natural with no chemicals.  I only give the BEST to my boy and I know that by giving him the Milk Bone Trail Mix he's getting a treat but at the same time it's a healthy choice!!	1	0
1	B001ZXJ8P4	A1T48KDK82HSZR	Great for little power chewers	"I have two little power chewers (under 20 pounds each) who can tear through a regular rawhide roll in a couple of hours. After three days they each could only manage to eat about one fourth of a roll. These rolls are gigantic compared to the regular 10"" rolls I have been giving them. I had to cut them in half to make them easier for my dogs to handle. Usually, my dogs strip off large pieces of a rawhide roll but they couldn't do that with these rolls, the hide is too thick (it ranges from about 1/8"" to 1/4"" thick). Four of these rolls lasted for about a month with two small dogs chewing on them for about two hours every day."	0	0
1	B000B8UOXY	A2BXADZA7108HT	Great for dogs with allergies	Approved by my vet for my dog with food allergies.  He loves the taste and the crunch.  The fries are long, so I just break them into fourths.	0	0
-1	B007RTR8A2	A1QBOC76MIOJYP	Good for a basic shampoo	"This shampoo was good as a basic shampoo. It is a thick shampoo that smells good, lathers very well and rinses easily. My hair did not feel like straw/dry after using it. It is advertised as a ""dry scalp"" shampoo though, and I did not feel like it did anything at all for the dry scalp issue, so I did knock off 2 stars for that. It is great as an everyday shampoo, though, and should be marketed as just that. If it was marketed as just ""shampoo"" with no mention of the dry scalp, it would have been a 5 star product.<br /><br />If you're thinking of using the matching conditioner - it wasn't bad, but not the best. I would have liked to see better moisturizing and detangling qualities. While using the set, I did not see an improvement with dry scalp problems."	0	0

-1	B004E4EBMG	A2ZBC57OQXUPN6	I will pass thanks.	Yikes.  I feel like the odd woman out, but I really did not like the peach mio.  I like the idea of adding as much of it (or as little as I want).  I don't like my flavored water to be too overwhelmingly flavored if that makes sense.  However, the little I used it made it taste like a watered down glass of Koolaid to me.  I tried it again and used more and it still tasted like a watered down drink, but with a bite on the end that was not mango peach flavored.  It was just not very good which is a disappointment.  This little container would have been perfect on the go.	1	1

I can buy this locally for $54.95 plus 6.5% tax for a total of $58.58!  I have check other places online and I have come to the conclusion that buying locally is the least expensive.<br /><br />I have been feeding Natura's Innova dry puppy and, later, large breed dog food to my 1-year old Golden Retriever mix since I adopted him at 11-weeks, and, the past few years, Innova Senior to my 11-year old Lab mix, 4 cups a day for the former who is almost 80-pounds, and 2 cups a day for the latter who is 65-pounds.<br /><br />For years, I fed my Lab mix Science Diet because it was touted as  recommended by vets.  But, when skin issues developed (scratching) I started doing research and began my dog food education. I was surprised to learn about ""sub-prime"" ingredients and how much grain is used as filler.  I switched to Nutro for a few years and that helped the allergies.  More reading and I graduated to Innova.  Expensive?  Yes. I cringe every time I buy a bag and a part of me thinks there is a very large profit being made by the seller.  But, knowing that I am feeding a quality dog food to my dogs, priceless.  They are healthy, happy, and my Lab mix seldom scratches himself anymore.<br /><br />The next step up would be Natura's EVO, a no-grain food, but unlike cats whose main ingrediant in their diets must be meat and would benefit from a no-grain diet, a dog diet may include vegetables, grains, and fruits, so I will probably stick with Innova.<br /><br />So, 5-stars for the food, 0-stars for the ""bargain"" price."	5	1
1	B001PMC3O8	A1K82R24ROO2I7	Happy whiskers and two paws way up!	*Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!	10	0

-1	B004051BO0	A1KMG1AIUS00DC	Not a plesant combination of flavors	"I am not a tea drinker, so I let my wife try this product since she enjoys tea and has several varieties on hand at any given time.  She was eager to try this vanilla spice tea, since she had never had tea flavored in such a way.<br /><br />She had the tea as a mid-afternoon ""pick me up,"" intrigued by its package claim, ""energizes the body and focuses the mind.""  Her initial reaction was not enthusiastic.  In fact, she wasn't thrilled with the combination of vanilla and tea.  She looked at the package information and found that an 8-ounce cup of this tea contains only 10 mg. less caffeine than an equivalent cup of coffee, so the ""Naturally energizes without the jitters"" package claim is misleading.  The tea contains quite a bit of caffeine.<br /><br />She tried a second cup the next day, wanting to be sure to give it a fair evaluation.  The second cup confirmed her opinion.  Yogi's Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy tea is far less satisfying than peppermint tea, green tea, or orange spice tea, three of her favorites.  She would not be inclined to try this product again."	0	2
-1	B005VOOM2W	APVK8GGSSUDCE	Pretty weak flavor	I don't know what makes Organic coffee different from regular coffee, and in this instance, I honestly don't care.  I'm used to Starbucks coffee, as well as the occasional Pete's coffee, as well had coffee in France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being strongest coffee, this Marley brand coffee is like a 2.  Weaker than the old-style McDonald's coffee (before McCafe's came about).  Weaker than instant coffee.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other flavors and nuances to this coffee, but I honestly can't get past the weak flavor.  Perhaps, if you like weak coffee, this may be for you, and maybe the organic process leaches stuff out, but for me, this one's not to my taste.<br /><br />At least the flavor's not bitter.	0	0
-1	B005NDY0XC	A34JPMO00Y4U2V	small for the price	The product is good, the meat and cheese were as good I remember for pass years.  Unfortunately I found the amount of product very small.  There was more packaging then product.  What I mean is that the packaging made it look like you were getting more them there actually was.  I remember is years past you were able to get more for the money and in this case I felt is was a lot less even in today's economy.	1	0

As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to ""improve"" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet!

I will enjoy a Cafe Mocha or a drink made with expresso and heavy cream...so it basically doesn't taste like coffee. I bought this because I love caramel flavored drinks. I will agree that the caramel flavor is not as strong as one would think, but if you add a flavored creamer, it tastes wonderful. I used a caramel macchiacto creamer and it was delish. I can't wait to try this with a mocha flavor and maybe some Cinnamon and sugar.<br /><br />I never encountered the ""chemical"" taste mentioned above."	1	2
-1	B000FAIRCI	A40DBB846M2MQ	Too hot to handle	Red Chile (not green) are in the sauce and the amount exceeds other spices by a wide margin - can not even taste the other namesake ingredients such as garlic and basil due to quantity of red chile - would not recommend.	1	4
1	B0000GHNT0	A25ZAIWSAVAFK2	Nice kick, great flavor, good on anything.	"I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other ""insane"" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption.<br /><br />Not this hot sauce.  It's perfectly hot enough, yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle.  I put it on everything:  Burger too blah with the normal condiments, El Yucateco can fix it!  Shrimp cocktail not kicking, El Yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss.  I even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat.<br /><br />It's definitely hot.  If all you're used to is normal, red-colored vinegar water, this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire.  But, if you're looking for something with good flavor that'll keep you coming back for more, this is the stuff."	7	0

1	B000CSEFLU	A3FVXID782DOJF	Good portion control, manufacturer sealed	We own a condo in Florida and I constantly have to be aware of the humidity when we aren't there.  What I like about these packages is that for one thing it's portion control and for another it is manufacturer sealed so I can leave them down there. When we get there the next time, I don't have to run out to the store to buy cereal for the next day.  Which means I can leave them at the condo over the summer and the humidity won't affect them.<br /><br />While I would have preferred to have purchased a smaller amount of boxes, I will most likely wind up donating some of them to the local soup kitchen.<br /><br />Originally, I got some at a hotel and used them down there.  That's how I found out how convenient they were.  While more expensive than purchasing a large box of the cereal, once opened I can't leave the box of cereal down there but I can leave these.	0	0

There is just the right amount of heartiness to make it an enjoyable coffee experience, and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma.  It is not as strong as an espresso, but maybe one step below.  Like we said, ""pleasant, smooth, and flavorful!"""	3	0

-1	B003ZT61E2	A1IQV6AI7L9NOK	Tasty (but doesn't taste like coffee)	"Let me tell you all a secret: I don't actually like coffee that much.  There I said it.  I ordered this product anyway because it sounded really good from the description.  So, now that you know what perspective I'm coming from, let me describe my impression of this drink.<br /><br />Well, it's more like hot chocolate than coffee.  Seriously, my impression is that this tastes very little like coffee and much more like a Peppermint Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa.  That's fine with me, as since I mentioned earlier I don't really care that much for coffee.  So, really, what you've got here is ""latte"" that tastes like hot chocolate.<br /><br />There are some other issues I should mention, it's very pepperminty - in fact, it may be too strongly peppermint for some people's tastes.  The other issue is that it takes a TON of teaspoons of powder to make a normal average-sized mug.  I think I used like six on one mug.  That's not efficient at all compared to a normal-sized packet of hot chocolate.  Speaking of hot chocolate, since this tastes like hot chocolate, you really should just buy hot chocolate instead because it's a much cheaper, better value per ounce than this stuff.  So, given the things I've mentioned, I can't really recommend this ""latte"" drink mix to fans of coffee at all, or to fans of hot chocolate just based on price alone.  So really, I guess that means it's just not recommended!"	0	0

-1	B002OFZMPW	A1MLQY4WBCWD31	Great product but the subscription ships old products.	I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.	2	0

-1	B000MWYAMU	A37XF3OXUBXK9E	Not so good......	I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does.  It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland).  I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better.  I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.<br /><br />  I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort).  I would suggest trying to locate this product locally and trying it before you buy it in the bulk 6 bag size from Amazon to make sure it is a taste and texture you would like, we didn't!	1	0

Buffy, Princess of Goldens, loves these and takes each daily treat out to the front yard to roll on before consuming - high praise from her. My vet recommended them over the usual grain, fat, and corn syrup based treats. This is one of the few treats I'm comfortable with giving daily, it's not doggie junk food.	1	0

-1	B0012BSMHY	A2DWEZ8PJZR6I9	Stash Premium Mint Green Iced Tea Powder	As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.	2	0
-1	B004WTHCO2	ABXJ3JML948L0	Get an Immersion Blender instead	Totally not worth it!<br />Babies eat the really fine purees for such a small amount of time and it is important to continually increase the texture.  I found that a $5 steamer basket and $15 Immersion Blender did a much better job and allowed me to make larger quantities of food with better texture results.<br /><br />In addition the area where you add water started to rust so I really question the craftsmanship here.	0	0
-1	B0090X8IPM	A1A535TCGNMVPI	Starbucks Vanilla Coffee????	"How I was looking forward to good Starbucks Vanilla Coffee at home!  When I got the box with this coffee inside, the vanilla aroma was coming through the box!  Even the UPS man said ""something smells good in there.""  Opened the box and saw the bag and, it had that good coffee smell with vanilla added.  So good I had to read the directions and make some of this Vanilla starbucks!  The coffee came already ground, not full beans.<br /><br />Oh, I was counting on this being so tasty!  Making it, the aroma it gave off was good.  Drinking it, YUCK, yuck, yuck!  It had one of the worse tastes I've ever tasted.  Like a rubbery, strong, sour vanilla taste. Yes, I know Starbucks coffee is strong, but this is a nasty strong vanilla taste.  Well I dumped it all out, washed everything and the next morning made it again.  Also I had to get rid of that taste in my mouth through a regular cup of coffee!<br /><br />So the next morning I made another batch of this Starbucks Vanilla.  Took extra close attention to the directions to make sure I was doing everything right (which I was).  Tried one cup black, another with cream and sugar.  The same all times!  A terrible taste!  I don't know it's a bad batch of beans, or too much Vanilla was added or bad vanilla was added or what, but it's bad.  Even other family members agree on the taste.<br /><br />A note here.  I went to a Starbucks coffee house and asked the girl at the counter working.  Before I got far she said ""that has to be from a grocery store, Starbucks took it off the menu a while ago.""  I looked and sure enough it's not on the menu!  I asked why and she shrugged her shoulders.<br /><br />Well I was disappointed on this. Actually I'm surprised as I do not think this Vanilla Coffee represents the Starbucks name well.  I've had many different types of their coffee before and never have I tasted something this bad."	2	1

1	B005MGDP90	A18EYTHURMGN8N	Very Potent	This has a much saltier taste than table salt or even sea salt. I think I like sea salt better than this stuff, but that is quite probably just personal preference. I find that sea salt has more of a mouth watering quality, whereas this salt is more of a sharp saltiness.<br /><br />It would be excellent for desserts - like salt water taffy or a salty caramel.	0	0

We then rinse out the Baby Brezza to keep any baby food from drying in it so it is simple to wash later.<br /><br />Our 7 month old enjoys the food made in the Baby Brezza with pears and honeydew being his current favorites.	0	0
1	B001D0KG4Q	A26C4GW1JQ8PTN	Just read the fine print	Yes, it does include tea, and a lemon drink, but now amazon does state that in the description.<br />What I found slightly disappointing was that I had mixed quantities of each item in the 48 pack.  I had 2 of some drink and 4 or 5 of another.  Makes me wonder if I was missing any flavors.  Just be prepared for a true variety.  I found Timothy's coffee's to be a much bolder, stronger taste than the Gloria Jean's variety I tried.	2	0
1	B002DPWQWA	ATJ0W78OLZBD8	Tried many, this is the best	"I have two adult male beagles and have tried quite a few ""boutique"" level dog foods from Innova and Orijen over the past couple of years since they seem to be perennial favorites.  I monitored my dogs closely from their stools to their coat and immediate response after eating.  I found the Innova lines to make them lick their chops for about 10 minutes after each meal (likely due to the very high protein levels).  They also gained a little bit of weight so I had to cut down their intake (to what seemed like almost nothing).  This food, as I understand, is better suited for high-energy/activity dogs.<br /><br />The original Orijen was better, but the fish-based proteins and Omega 3s ranked high for me, so I ended up switching to the 6 Fish.  They've been enjoying it for a little over a year and the popularity has grown so much that at one point this year, it was almost impossible to find.  It has also received a few awards this past year.  The 29.7 lb bag lasts the two about 2 months.<br /><br />In short, Orijen 6 Fish has drastically improved the coat, stool, energy level, and overall health of my two beagles compared to any store bought brands."	10	0

Great to take with us when we are going out as compared to big bulky and heavy bottles (ie Earths Best baby food)  The only issue we had was that my wife, for some reason, could never open the top.  She would always screw it up somehow.  Easy fix however, just have daddy open it.  Also wish it was re sealable, but our son ate all of the Gobbe Gobble 95% of the time so wasn't an issue.

-1	B0059YB39O	ALMMCMLBESHGH	Salt licks	Pro: It is probably close to the genuine article.

It does not actually taste like a culinary creation.  It seems like chemically preserved salted beef.  It is so bad, I am thinking that I could make a better version by putting some sliced beef seasoned with salt, pepper, and sugar in a large biscuit tin along with a smouldering hickory block.	0	1
1	B001LQTJ3Q	AI5D0QUKTJQQ8	Wonderful flavor	My wife lived in Wales for many years as well as her Mother having spent most of her life there...drinking lots of tea... when I met my wife, she drank PG Tips which I too began to drink (I was always a coffee drinker prior). PG Tips was ok, but weak, not too much flavor, etc...

-1	B002YFZ7IY	A1YXTNWAO0YPIR	Orijen and small dogs	As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet. I would hate to see anyone go through what I've experienced with my dog.	10	2

In moments of weakness, I have been known to eat a whole package of chocolate chip cookies, with chocolate milk.  I was barely able to eat two of these goo-balls.  On one hand, maybe that's a good thing - it forced me to moderation.  But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.<br /><br />Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are chocofudge.

-1	B001C15JCU	A1V87K5ACKN3WJ	Kingdom Pets Chichen Jerky caused bloody diarrhea in my puppy.	"Last October I purchased a 3-pound bag of this product at Costco and stuck it in my panty until my French Bulldog puppy was old enough to chew it. At seven months, I unsealed the bag and gave her one piece. I could tell that she loved the taste as I watched her consume it.<br /><br />The next day, she wasn't at all interested in her morning feeding (this never happened before) and she was acting very weird. She was making very strange postures with her body (in hindsight this was probably a mild seizure). Then I noticed that during the night, she had had some bouts of diarrhea out of her dog potty on my laundry room floor. I took her to her vet and she sent in a fecal test to the lab. (The next day, the test came back negative.) The vet told me to feed her rice and chicken and gave me a feeding schedule along with Fortiflor powder to put on her food to build up the ""good"" bugs in her digestive tract. The vet diagnosis was that of Colitis.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't associate the eating of the chicken jerky treat with this incident so about two months later, I gave her another one of these treats and like before, she relished it. The next morning, again she was acting listless and wouldn't go near her morning feeding. This time she had fresh blood stains around her anus. I freaked out. I went to the laundry room and there was bloody diarrhea all over the place. I immediately took her to see her vet. Again, the vet sent in a fecal test which came back negative the next day. This time the vet prescribed a medication for Giardia (just in case) and an antibiotic and told me to put her on the rice and chicken diet again. My puppy was on this medication for a week to 10 days (I don't remember exactly).<br /><br />I STILL didn't catch on to the chicken jerky/bloody diarrhea association, so last week I fed her another one of the chicken jerky strips. The next morning, I  saw that she had bloody diarrhea again and FINALLY realized the association between feeding the chicken strip and my puppy getting sick! I am 100% POSITIVE that the treat caused my dog all of her gastrointestinal problems. I know that she is NOT allergic to chicken. I googled ""Kingdom Pets Chicken Jerky"" and found all kinds of reports of people experiencing similar reactions with their small dogs after feeding this treat. I only wish that I had realized the association earlier, and I could have spared my little girl a lot of pain and discomfort (and about (...) in vet bills).<br /><br />I read the FDA warning on their website, I called Costco to report it, and I left a message on the Kingdom Pets Voicemail. I also phoned the FDA complaint coordinator in my area (N. California) and spoke to the S. California coordinator who told me that MANY similar complaints have been made about this product. I wonder how many complaints have to be reported before this product is banned? If this was a ""people"" food, I'm sure it would have been recalled immediately. However, since it's only for dogs... .<br /><br />The Kingdom Pets man called me the next day and told me that the product had been thoroughly tested and found to be safe. He did admit that he was aware that some dogs were not able to ""tolerate"" the treat and that those owners should just NOT FEED IT. Of course he had to say that so his company would not be culpable. What a crock! I just hope that my nine-month old puppy hasn't suffered permanent damage to her organs.<br /><br />FDA WARNING:  (...)<br />DON'T RISK YOUR DOG'S HEALTH; DON'T FEED THIS TREAT TO YOUR SMALL DOG!!"	30	11

There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.	4	2

After going through several other brands, I'm glad I found this one here on Amazon. It always works perfectly and I get the same great crema all the time. The taste is exactly the way I like it, and it reminds me of what I've tried at espresso bars across Italy, especially Autogrill. Lavazza is a household name in Italy, and one of the most trusted brands when it comes to coffee.

-1	B001QEEXCK	A1S2GUIPPNHBJW	New formula nothing like old!	We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars.	1	1
-1	B001ELLB20	A2AGBA6KKBET1P	Do not buy!!!!!  It's the worst ever !!!!!!	Let me start by saying, I have been on over a year long quest to find the perfect loose mint tea.  This is the worst out of several teas I've tried. Very bad tasting.  The mint is ground down to a very fine powder, which makes sure all the oils (flavor) evaporates leaving no flavor.  If you use a mesh strainer you will notice the tea will escape the strainer instantly.  The zipper that is in the bag comes pre-broken for your ultimate displeasure.  Can't even think of one good thing to say about this tea.  It just tastes bad.  Didn't notice the stomach soothing effect noticed with all other mint teas I've tried.  This was a purchase I regret x2.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this horrible product.  When describing this tea I use a lot of swear words.	0	2

1	B000W5SLB8	A2DZA9JI80LE8H	Fantastic for dogs with skin allergies	I started my 5 year old German Shepherd (and myself) on a grain free diet this year. He has always had terrible, flaky, dry skin and I always thought just supplementing his diet with fish oil would help. That was only part of the equation. I had him on (what I thought was) a premium dog food all of his life, and while he would eat it, he was never THAT excited about it. Since I have had him on Taste of the Wild his skin has cleared up, his coat is shinier than it ever has been, and he has TONS more energy.<br /><br />Make no mistake, dogs are omnivores but their biology is still stuck in the days when their ancestors ate meat as the staple of their diet. They shouldn't be eating grain. This is a quality, affordable, grain free food. If you are thinking of switching your dog to a grain free formula I would strongly consider this. My dog goes wild for this stuff, going so far as to start eating it as I'm transferring it into the storage container. I'm so glad that I can order this from amazon and have it delivered to my door. Its super convenient.	1	1
1	B0038B3AAK	A1KN4C3DSWMMMU	My daily supplements..	"This is one of the best products in the array of ""greens"" out on the market.  The taste is most definitely one of the best.  Green Superfood is a great addition to a balanced alkaline/acid diet.  When my body is overly acidic (which is obvious when my stomach or body is sluggish or feeling like I'm coming down with something), I make a shake and it helps to balance it out.  I used to add a few items to the mix to make it even more powerful, i.e. fresh kale, banana, aloe, and flax oil.  Nowadays I simply use a frozen half banana, flax oil, and a touch of carob powder.  Mix it up with a bit of ice and you have a great shake, especially good during the summer months.  And for some crazy ideas, especially during the really hot months, add a bit of Baileys or Kahlua to the mix.  Yum, yum!  It's like having your vegetables with your junk food.  Or maybe try adding some Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream and present it to the kids (sans the liquor, of course).  There is a kids version of this product, also.  Both an adult version and the kids version come in chocolate, but I like making that decision for myself, so I buy the plain.  This is a great way to get your vits/minerals in a powdered, raw food product.  It's gluten free, vegan, and no soy fillers.  Also, 70% organic.  You would have to eat a truck load of raw foods to get the same level of nutrients that you receive in one scoop of Amazing Grass Green SuperFood.  And no, I do not work for the company."	17	2
-1	B003ULDY18	A1BZUD9EJGM8UX	Weak, no flavor	"I drank Numi Gunpowder Green about 4 years ago and fell in love with it. Because of the high cost I decided to cut back and try other high quality, less expensive teas. I recently was in the grocery and saw Numi gunpowder green and decided to check it out again. I ordered three boxes of it and upon making my first cup I instantly thought ""this stuff has drastically changed"" It is so light in flavor that it seriously is like green water. I don't know what happened to the original Numi gunpowder green, but it needs to come back!"	0	1

-1	B00066CRXG	AOHE0Q0YMWUMR	made in China	After reading an article today about the FDA cautioning pet owners about chicken jerky and chicken strips made in China, I am wondering if that is what caused my dog do be so ill (and $380 in vet bills) three weeks ago, a few hours after eating a Vitality Chicken Breast strip. He has eaten them in the past and loved them and has since (before I read the article) had a few more from the same package without incident. His illness (throwing up, bloody stool, loss of appetite) might be unrelated but I am throwing away the rest of the package and staying away from dog foods made in China.	0	0
-1	B004FELBH8	A4JHEO7H330AF	Not an exciting product.	"NABISCO NEWTONS FRUIT THINS CRISPY COOKIES comes in a 10.5 ounce package.  In side, is a clear plastic drawer that can be pulled out and pushed back in.  The drawer has two compartments.  The bag is made of foil, and it has a sturdy aluminum clasp for re-sealing.  Now, this is about what is inside. Inside, there are about 28 cookies.  I cannot be totally sure, since I already consumed a few.  The cookies are colored light brown and they have a wavey, scalloped edge.  The cookies are not soft and they are not particularly crisp.  They are in-between.  There are little flecks of dark stuff here and there, which are bits of figs and raisins.  The flavor can be characterized as ""generic.""  The flavor is like JUICY FRUIT CHEWING GUM.  In other words, it does not have any particular flavor.  The fruit component of these cookies is not convincing.  Using the term ""Newtons"" in the name of this product does not do justice to real fig newtons.  Real fig newtons, as everybody knows, is mostly fruit.  But I would guess that the quantity of fruit in these cookies is under 0.5%.  And so, what I say to the food scientists at Nabisco (Kraft Foods) is, ""Nice try, food scientists, but you have not in any way improved upon the classic fig newton!  And you have not even come close to the original!"""	1	0

-1	B0043ODJU2	A36P8V1JZ04II4	Vinegar Packed!	"This item was delivered on 9/20/12 and the bottle label was different.  It had a yellow and green background color and more importantly, stated ""Green Peppercorns in Vinegar.""  Of course the web site has a different label and advertises green peppercorns in brine which is what I was seeking.  Don't know if this is a onetime event due to an inventory mistake or what but just keep in mind that Amazon's policy is NO RETURNS ON FOOD ITEMS (including wrongly shipped food items).  I had to do a work around with the Amazon Returns online process (used a different refundable item to get a chat line open) and did manage a refund.  That's the good news.  The bad news is it took a lot more time than it should have to resolve an Amazon error.  If Amazon doesn't fix this issue (i.e., refunding ALL incorrectly shipped items that cannot be returned), I suggest not fooling around and just disputing charges directly with your credit card company and let Amazon sort it out on their time."	1	0

-1	B000FDMQAE	A118Z7MCJ9H5K	Not what I expected	A friend of mine gave me a taste of his spelt cakes and told me how healthy they were, especially for people on a low carb diet.  They were quite good considering that they aren't a hunk of fresh hot Italian bread.  He always buys Paskesz Spelt Cakes and after I read the one review of the Paskesz product, I found that the reviewer ordered that brand only because these Suzie's Spelt Cakes were out of stock.  Thinking that this person actually knew what she was talking about when she said how wonderful the Suzie brand was, I went ahead and ordered the Suzie spelt cakes and they are awful.  They have a very strong taste and they are vile - especially compared to the Paskesz ones I should have ordered to begin with.  Now I have 11 packages of this dry, tasteless, puffy spelt that I will feed to the ducks in my back yard when they start arriving in my canal. I hope I don't kill them.	0	0
1	B000KV61FC	A31FYZK04YNOJ5	Amazing way to provide treats	I have been searching for some good toys for my little pup.  After him beating up some of his stuffed animals, I knew i needed to provide something more durable and safe.  I came across this while searching for dog toys, and loved the idea that it is not only a toy, but a reward/education system.  After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall).	1	0
1	B004N7YQQA	AMY0JIT4U7XP9	Love, Love this Olive Oil!	I LOVE PONS organic olive oil! PONS has graced pasta, salads, seafood, rice, farmer's market veggie dishes and dips for fresh bread (with a little Celtic Sea Salt) for several years. Exceptional taste, wonderful quality (organic, extra virgin) - it is SO delicious! I've sampled dozens of olive oils (there is such a great variety of taste and flavors available). PONS is my personal favorite by far. I moved away and couldn't find it in any of the local stores, so I placed an order with pastacheese via Amazon (great experience/packed well/timely arrival - thank you pastacheese!) Very happy to have my favorite olive oil again :)	0	0
1	B002PI82P0	A2VZFYKOK7JWYU	Perfect coffee, customized for taste and quantity	The Saeco machine gives my wife and I that perfect cup of coffee brewed from freshly ground beans, at whatever time we want and in whatever quantity from 1/4 to full cup.  And, we don't have to leave home to get it!  The strength of each brew can be adjusted with the turn of a knob.  The machine is light weight and setting it up is easy.  The Saeco is easy to clean and has a nice upscale look on the kitchen counter.  Each individual cup is quickly made with the push of a button which provides a fresh hot cup rather than a pour from a pot that has been sitting on a warming plate.  There are no pods to open and change out each time, either.  We just bought another machine for my office!	0	0
1	B002ZNW346	A2KR7B80XP25AR	Pricey But well worth it!	Ever since our 2 mini poodles and 2 Maltipoo came in to our household they stole our hearts and became a part of our family. The hunt for the right food came when I heard countless horror stories from friends and family on how leading brand name foods affected and even caused the death of their pets. We all know how costly vet bills can me and because of this reason I believe that being proactive and taking preventive care will be a lot cheaper in the long run. Certain grains and corn are not a natural part of a dogs diet and as you know most or all advertised brands use that as one of their main ingredients. What i love this brand is that it doesnt skimp on any of the right ingredients and makes meat/poultry/etc. (depending on the flavor you buy) the main ingredient! this is awesome because there really isnt any other brand out there that is true to their pet owners and their pets! This manufacturer makes me feel like they actually care and thus they will get my money for their 1 of a kind and amazing food! My dogs love it, they have beautiful coats, they are energetic and healthy all around. Been using this for about 3 years now and will continue to do so. This is our households choice of food- the right food.	5	0
1	B0018CE7BC	A1GBEC0IZ5XJIE	Looks like good stuff!	The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.	1	0

1	B004HOLD92	A3QNQQKJTL76H0	Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?	"These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. ""BOLD"" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!"	0	0

I have an excellent source of fresh raw cows milk and I've tried 24 and 48 hour culturing.  I've tried draining it using a plastic can colander and straining it in a regular plastic colander.  Maybe kefirs vary from source to source.  I am still new at this.  So far I just mix part of the curds into already made yogurt and put the rest back into the jar to make more of this stuff.

-1	B0051COPH6	A1UQNX8S78JU0G	Great ingredients, bad taste	"I like this baby food because it contains nothing but organic, whole food ingredients.  The packaging is also handy, it comes in a flexible pouch that appears to be space saving.  The packaging is BPA free, however I do not know if it is lined with another type of plastic which may be equally nasty.  I tried the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens - it has broccoli which is a super food, however I would add a small caution because it contains spinach.  Spinach has oxalic acid which depletes calcium, so it is not advised to eat spinach more than once a week.  I see this product as a great, healthy choice if you need a packaged food product for six months or older babies.  I see this product being especially useful when traveling with a baby since it does not need to be refrigerated.<br /><br />Update to review - taste test by three kids:  I taste tested this product with three kids ages 2, 6, and 10.  The two year old immediately spit it out on the floor.  Six year old got the worst pickled prune face at the taste of it and groaned, and the 10 year old shouted ""disgusting""!  The verdict?  The taste of this food is pretty bad to children of many ages."	0	1

-1	B002RBTV78	A3LDIN6BPXJO8T	Poor quality - storage?	I agree with the others' comments about buying from Amazon.<br /><br />We've ordered these chocolates before directly from Lindt and they've arrived in perfect condition - crisp shiny shells that SNAP when you bite into them, and fillings that literally melted in your mouth. So when Amazon offered them at a special price and sent directly from Amazon with free shipping, even better, right?<br /><br />Wrong. I don't know how these were stored but they arrived in mid-April when temps in Chicago the entire week before had ranged from the low 30s to the mid 50s, but they'd obviously been subjected to much warmer conditions. The shells were soft and kind of sticky and with none of the usual Lindt gloss, and the fillings were almost the same texture. The taste was barely adequate but the texture was not even close to what it should be even if you'd bought them off a grocer's shelf and a number of them even had dents in the shells although so far none seem to have been completely melted.<br /><br />If you can buy them directly from Lindt in the middle of December, you'll probably be ok. Otherwise think twice before ordering unless you can be pretty sure they've been properly stored.	8	1

1	B003H26J5I	A37XG57IZUM9XO	Im impressed!	I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet.

However, a few years ago I moved to Hawaii, and had to order this tea from Amazon.com<br /><br />I bought 6 boxes of 50 bags of the Ahmad English Afternoon Tea and upon opening the boxes the first thing I noticed was a VERY strong smell of bergamot. Upon brewing the tea,<br />the taste and smell of bergamot was overwhelming. I think the bergamot is even stronger than Earl Gray tea. So I am sadly disappointed that this Ahmad English Afternoon Tea was<br />very different from the one I had been buying for years.<br /><br />Maybe the blend was recently changed? Could it be a quality control issue? I emailed Ahmad Tea and got NO response about this matter so I am posting this after a fair attempt to get an explanation.<br /><br />Buyer beware, Ahmad Tea may be selling ""rejects"" on their online store."	1	1

-1	B000N43JHY	A2OMZWR5GUI31D	Not bad tea	I bought this tea as I had one of the Senseo machines.  I was a little disappointed that you need an extra tray for the machine in order to use them.  I think this is a poor design for the machine and is just more clutter in my house.  As for the tea itself, I never really used it in the Senseo machine because it really doesn't work right without the second tray.  I have used it as just a seep in a regular cup of hot water and it is fine.  Some other reviews said this is weak tea and I can see that if it is run through the machine.	0	0

1	B001E530J8	A1IWCCJJ10TRUC	Best tasting everyday coffee!	In my opinion, Yuban is the best tasting of all the everyday coffees for home or office. In the aroma and flavor categories, Yuban beats Maxwell House and Foldgers hands down! But, honestly, who the heck would pay the prices listed by these sellers? $75 for two 33oz cans of Yuban... seriously?! Locally, I buy the 44oz can of Yuban for $10.49 at a discount grocery or, if I'm hard up, just a litter more than $12 for a 33oz can at any of the corporate grocery stores. When I read one review stating that the price on Amazon.com was good, I thought to myself that this person either has money to burn or is just plain clueless about the cost of goods.	1	0
1	B000LQHWYK	A13Y6XRW1I0R3F	Best Licorice ever!	So, I've been a fan of licorice for decades, and tried too many brands.  This one is a standout! Rich licorice flavor, chewy but neither rock hard or too soft.  Hard to find - I've literally gone to Cost Plus MANY times, seen full racks of other brands, and this specific formulation always sells out - and is hard to find. Now I get it on the 'Net.  Other formulations by Katjes are not as good, in my view.	1	0

Wish I wrote that but it's off the box.So is this ""We make glutenfree delicious..it's what we do"" and boy did Glutenfreeda do it again.I've been hooked on Glutenfreeda products since they introduced their frozen cookies years ago. I was delighted to see them come out with instant oatmeal and I wasn't disappointed.I was doubly delighted to see the oatmeal offered on Amazon.com. Win,win! When you read the ingredient list you will see why- Off the Maple Raisin with Flax box :certified gluten free oats, raisins, organic maple sugar,brown sugar , flax meal and salt.That's it and yes you read the ingredient list correctly.Real ingredients for my real family.I was very happy to see a very low sodium content and the addition of flax.<br /><br />I always have a packet with me for a quick snack or those ""eat at the desk"" lunches. My husband who is not on the gluten free diet loves this oatmeal.He says the oats taste fresher. And for my Celiac college student this product has made his life so much easier.He can have a healthy breakfast in his dorm room or at the food court with no worry of cross-contamination.Like me he always has a packet in his backpack for snacks or a quick lunch.<br /><br />Thank you Glutenfreeda!"	0	0
-1	B0033HPPIO	A25I2AZZ4CYZSX	Chemical taste and smell	This has been my least favorite coffee purchase so far for the Keurig. My husband came into the kitchen and thought I had been conducting a science experiment as it smelled like chemicals. The flavor is also a combination of plastic and chemicals. I would have been happy if it even had a cafe mocha flavor like other reviewers have called it, but I don't even begin to get that. Very disappointed.	4	4

He does not buy them for dietary reasons - he is in excellent shape.  He prefers the reduced fat variety because they are MORE CRISP than their counterparts.  Highly recommended!"	6	0
1	B00866AM2G	A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ	Great stuff in a problematic container	"This coconut water is superior to any other that includes sugar. Period. I've tried ""80% coconut water"", ""83%"" etc. but they're just too sweet to savor the fresh coconut taste. This is the closest I've tasted to something right out of the coconut. It's slightly sour, as the real thing is.<br /><br />Problem is, if you don't use a straw - I prefer not to so I can easily re-seal the pack - the design of the pack leaves some water sloshing around at the end which is hard to get at without using a straw, cutting open the pack, or trying to bounce it out the opening. Which is really annoying, considering the thought of missing even a sip of this stuff.<br /><br />It's pricier than a lot of other options, but when you just have to have the sensation of drinking coconut water, you have few alternatives. Get the subscription and save a few bucks."	1	0
-1	B000U9V59Q	AMDH9WZHBLCDB	HIDEOUS!	This is actually a flavoring agent that starts with an aftertaste.

1	B0013TM22G	AIUZ6U9PI0UW9	Bewildering and delicious candy!	"I first tried this candy while out on a hike, and decided that I needed to get some of my own! It's like a cross between a nerd and a jelly bean, with the outside being hard and sour while the inside is soft and sweet. Also, the different colors actually do indicate distinct flavors, which I always appreciate in a candy. Oh, and by giant, they mean about jelly bean size, but they range in size from about 1/4 of an inch to 3/4 of an inch. The only down side to this product is that inside the package are 24 ""small"" packets of the candy, which is a LOT of packaging and bad for the environment. For me, the packets are also too big for a single serving (I get a sugar overload about halfway through one.) In short:<br /><br />Good:<br />- Amazing delicious candy<br />- Bewilderingly textured, which makes them really fun<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Too much packaging (I would rather just buy a big bag of loose candies)<br />- Single packets are too big for single serving"	0	0

1	B001E5E05G	A2KP45DO3RY4RG	Try it this way!	This is how I eat my kashi - in order to incorporate more coconut oil and more cinammon in my diet for my blood sugar and weight loss, etc. I melt 8 TBSPs of coconut oil in a big metal mixing bowl (1T per serving) and dump in the kashi and stir and stir till it seems to have absorbed the oil. Then I add cinammon to taste (at least 1-2 tsps) stir some more and then pour it in a pan and toast it at 350 for 10 minutes - the resulting cereal is absolutely fabulous and I like to mix it with my sugar free activia as well as milk.<br /><br />It's super! and for weight loss use it as a meal replacement and you'll drop weight like a stone.<br /><br />However, do not order this cereal from Amazon, as I post this they want over $4 per box. It's regularly $2.78 at my local Wal-mart.	0	1

-1	B004JRO1S2	A2OL0JTU0DLH6B	Save your money	I really hate giving a negative review to anything. That being said, I was not impressed with this product. It's called Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero sauce, but it was not bold and it was not spicy. It had a bland taste to it. It was not a bad taste, just bland. It was creamy though. I was hoping it was Taco Bell's Volcano sauce being marketed under a different name for supermarkets, but it wasn't. There was a slight chipolte taste to it, but I think there are better products out there. I tried this sauce on Taco Bell's new triple steak flatbread and ended up having to put some steak sauce on as well. I would not recommend this and it looks like others feel the same way as I have being seeing this on the shelfs of close-out store Big Lot's.	1	0

It's not strong like Starbucks, nor mellow and smooth like Dunkin's. It is mild with no aftertaste. I am a long time coffee lover and drink it black.<br /><br />The choice is sustainably grown organic coffee or taste?  I'm going to mix it up!	1	1
1	B000E48P4U	AO56WWW0WZUFI	Great snack	I originally purchased this jerky at because it was the ONLY jerky at the big box warehouse that wasn't full of Nitrates, Nitrites, and MSG.  It is more dry than the Original flavor Beef Jerky from Golden Valley.  I give it a four instead of a five because it tends to have fibrous 'strings' in it and several thin ribbons of fat (per bag, not per piece).  The flavor is very good, simple and 'sweet'(not sugar sweet, but good meat sweet).  The price on Amazon is Excellent.  I still buy this jerky but prefer the texture of the Golden Valley Beef Jerky since it's not quite the jaw workout that this Buffalo Jerky is.  All in all, I am very impressed with the high quality of this company's products.	2	0

-1	B003CK2BQG	ADNA24AADKBQ9	Not as good as I had hoped	I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.	12	1

"This salt is only $5.00 from the manufacturer's website, celticseasalt . c o m , further more this website and this manufacturer is highly deceptive, and it is obvious by the comments on this website. all modern sea salt has significantly less trace minerals than ancient himalayan sea salt. the manufacturer provides a graph that seems to indicate this salt has more than 3 times the trace minerals, when all they are really comparing is the moisture content. you are paying for about 12% water when you buy this product by weight, which is about 3 times the amount of water in himalayan salt.<br /><br />Himalayan salt forms an alkaline solution in water, due to its higher trace mineral content, while all modern sea salt forms acidic solutions. this salt does have a decent flavor, which i find goes well with fish, but for all other cooking, himalayan salt is both tastier and healthier. a lot of reviewers have been duped by the spurious and misleading information on the manufacturers website. this salt has a significantly lower ratio of trace minerals to sodium than himalayan salt.<br /><br />Finally, the mercury and other heavy metal content in modern sea salt is much higher than in himalayan salt. harvesting ""deep water"" which protects against many organic pollutants that float like gasoline in a street puddle, does nothing to prevent the increased levels of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and other heavy metals from getting into the salt."	60	16

So having this scent in my living room for the period of time it takes them to chew these is rather off-putting and I am looking for another chew for this reason.

1	B000EA0D26	AY7NS8Z7C9ESS	A little TLC for incredible sugar!	So misunderstood! A little TLC is needed, but Billington's is well worth the time! It quite often arrives hard. The solution: Place the unwrapped sugar in an airtight canister, slightly moisten a clean, folded (larger than the container opening) paper towel, place over the canister opening, not touching the sugar, and secure the lid. Come back in 2 to 3 hours, and you have a soft, golden sugar.  Remove the paper towel and store air tight.  It never clumps, is always soft, and absolutely delicious!	6	0
-1	B000ROR8Z4	A1ZSF5CJ0A4CIO	Some liked them, some ignored them	"My 6 Greyhounds received the chicken pot pie flavored treats as an early Easter surprise from their Auntie. Keeping in mind the size of my dogs, these treats are the teeniest, tiniest things I think I've seen. Maybe an inch long and 1/8"" high/deep, the dogs' canine teeth are bigger than these treats. Keeping in mind a treat this small will most likely be swallowed whole, I distributed them slowly to each pup. It was as if they were gulping air...I don't think the ones with enough teeth to chew even tasted them. The 2 with minimum teeth for whom I must moosh everything up got theirs crushed up in yogurt...those two girls wouldn't eat the yogurt. So, I can't tell if my pups like these or not; most didn't even taste them as they went down the hatch too quickly without chewing; the other two didn't like what they did to their favorite treat since losing their teeth, yogurt.<br /><br />They are wheat and corn free, listed as 100% natural and the ingredients list on the back of the little box are:<br />oat flour, rolled oats, potato flour, chicken broth, carrots, celery, canola oil, eggs, baking powder<br /><br />For the price, one can put those ingredients together at home (I will swap potato flour for whole wheat flour) and bake them yourself. Even if it takes a few tries to get the measurements right, the dogs will still eat them and you can make them any size that is appropriate for your pet(s). If baking them as hard treats is too time consuming for you, do what I do: mix it up like a meatloaf, bake it, cut into appropriately sized treat pieces, and keep in the frig. Easy enough and one can use leftovers from a meal rather than start with all new ingredients. Probably healthier for your pet too.<br /><br />However, we must still thank Auntie for allowing us to try something new. If it were not for the tiny size of these treats, they would most likely have been a great big hit here."	0	1
-1	B0083T5TAQ	A1YS688NJ8MPA	Disappointed - Half of them are not even flavored!!!? Waste of money.	I got a new Keurig coffee maker for Christmas, which was exciting to me, because I often want one cup of flavored coffee in the evening. So I went right to Amazon and found this great idea - a sampler of flavored coffees!  I thought this would be perfect, so I could find out which ones I'd like.  But when they arrived today, only half of them were flavored and the other half were non-flavored coffee.  And all of the flavored ones are doubles, so all in all I got 6 flavors.  What a disappointment! I feel like I wasted my money, because the coffee maker already came with a sampler of regular coffees.	0	0
-1	B003CIBPN8	A30Y6933LWCQTH	"This is coconut ""water"" not ""juice""."	I misread the label.  I was looking for real juice - not some water-down passion fruit flavoring.  It's like buying fruit punch when you actually want fruit juice.  And this is expensive coconut water.	0	7
-1	B001EO5KSS	A1FCMQT7KJXCIQ	Not a fan	I had tried Fiber One and though I loved it, I was looking for something organic. After reading the reviews, I decided to give Barbara's a try. I had an immediate disliking to its taste. After trying it repeatedly, I still can't come around to its taste. I guess it's not for everyone.	0	0

I bought this so I can pack single serve soy milk on my almost 2 day flight across the Atlantic for my toddler who is allergic to milk.<br />It worked well BUT I just noticed that it expires in less than 6 weeks from when I placed my order!!! I wished that that information was listed because I will not be able to finish it before it expires. What a waste!! :(	0	0
1	B0025UOOBE	A1P97LZ48WMYSC	Yum!	Mrs. Weiss' Kluski noodles have been around since I was a child. They don't sell them in local stores. It was easy to find on Amazon.com. I promptly ordered them so I could split the order with my Mom. This is a dumpling noodle and is used in many Polish dishes. It's so nice to have these in my pantry; especially when they arrived in a matter of days after I ordered them.	0	0
-1	B000G7TBUW	ALHINPGS325EN	Mini Pretzels	I had been looking for these unsalted pretzels for awhile.  I try to limit sodium, but love pretzels.  I used to live in PA (Snyder's headquarters) and could get them all the time.  Since moving to the midwest, I have not been able to find them.  I was very disappointed in them when they were shipped.  About 1/4 of the bag was pieces and crumbs.  Another reviewer mentioned this and I should have known, but I really had been craving pretzels and was hoping that Snyders had fixed their problem with shipping. Pretzels, great; shipping not so goood.	0	0
1	B005K4Q1VI	AMRI1HBLPI25L	Sugar AND Sucralose	I didn't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. I tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. I'll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini-splurge. I'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.	0	0
-1	B000MXJR54	ARZVMU42Z22G7	Good product but NOT VEGETARIAN.	This was the first container of rice cereal that our baby has tried.  He took to it very well, and I thougth buying the DHA formula cereal was a smart choice for his development as opposed to the regular.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I realized just as the container was almost gone (and I had already bought another container) that this product has tuna oil, as well as gelatin in it.  It is the source of DHA.  It's my fault for not reading the label more closely, but I really would have never guessed that a single grain baby cereal would have fish oil in it!  The formula we use also had DHA, but it is algae-based.  Just wondering why this has to be from a fish.  Gross.	4	9

"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.

-1	B001IQ1ITM	A35OZLF1LX264A	Repulsive	"I ordered the angel hair noodles, and after one bite, I threw them down the garbage disposal.  Their texture is not really ""al dente"", and they have no discernable flavor.  I covered them with my favorite pasta sauce, but their texture and tastelessness made them seem just awful.  The closest description I can come up with?  Imagine soggy styrofoam...then you have a sense of what I experienced.  I know that some people have given positive reviews.  Perhaps they are less particular; I don't know.  I ordered 4 bags, and I have three left.  I'll probably just throw them away; I can't imagine offering them to anyone else."	7	8

-1	B000V18TRE	A359HBR0BDI48G	Does not look like photo	I bought a single package of this from a supermarket at a reduced price as it was 1 month before its Best Before date.<br />The product photo shows fresh chunks of potatoes, carrots & green peppers. I really didn't notice the vegetables in the finished product - I assume they were there.<br />My sauced rice did not look like the photo either. The directions state to break the chunks of the precooked rice with the back of a spoon to separate the grains. This was hard to do & when I'm microwaving, I want quick food. Also the sauce was darker & surprisingly hot.	2	1
-1	B001VSXNNG	A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q	"The ""Original"" is the Better Choice. The garlic/lime variants are a bit heavy handed and don't match the quality of the Original"	"I much prefer the original Cholula hot sauce. This variant adds a heavy dose of lime to what was and is a good hot sauce.  Buy the original hot sauce and if you want to add some lime -- then add it yourself. At the very least, then you can control the amount of lime added.<br /><br />The original Cholula hot sauce was and is quite successful and for good reason -- it is really tasty. Unfortunately some marketing ""genius"" came up with a lime and garlic version of the original sauce. In both cases ---  the lime or garlic versions are so heavy handed that they obscure the finer nature of the underlying sauce.<br /><br />Try the original version before even considering these heavy handed variants.<br /><br />PS: Watch out for high shipping charges that do not decrease even if you are purchasing multiple bottles at the same time! Review the final shipping charges before you check out here on Amazon. They may be much higher than you where lead to believe. Some companies on Amazon attempt to profit by offering very low prices combined with very high shipping charges. Buyer be aware!"	2	0

-1	B001D0GV5E	A208B9JQOJSJX0	It's the Economy, Stupid	While the flavour of this green tea was enjoyable (as either hot or iced tea), its recent price increase is certainly not. Paying 74% more for this tea than one pays Amazon for the equivalent number of servings of Bigelow or Twinings green tea ($39.95 US vs $23.00 US) or 83 cents/cup rather than 48 cents/cup is not justified by the product's quality, perceived taste, or manufacturer reputation. I would not purchase this product again at its current price-point. Additionally, it appears the current retailer no longer supports the convenient Subscribe-and-Save option.	0	0

My Mensa-smart Cattledogs figured out the game immediately, opening the flaps just fine.  But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, ""Are you kidding me?"", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones."	0	0

I'd also love to be able to change the type of coffee I receive each month if possible... but I'm not sure if I can do that without canceling and resubscribing.<br /><br />Overall, this coffee is delicious.

1	B006VXU6ZO	A3DR8BX1BNT4DK	good coffee, cheaper elsewhere	We purchased this coffee yesterday for the first time. It's a very good coffee.. an 80 count box was under $25, that's half the price that it's listed for here. Of course it was at Costco.. The most worthwhile membership I've ever owned! If there is one near you, pay your membership.. buy your coffee there.. it will only take saving half the cost on your coffee on 2 boxes to pay yourself back for your membership! You can store your pods in a ziploc bag to maintain freshness after the celo packs are opened. If you are like us as coffee drinkers, it won't last long enough to get stale anyway.	1	2
1	B00066CRXG	A1IXRNN90NG20L	healthy dog treats	I have been buying these treats for my dogs for years because they are healthy and seem to taste good.

1	B000FPKX5C	A2ID5QQ1ZF9R2W	~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~	When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all.	5	0

The first time, the treats stayed in for about an hour but were devoured 5 minutes later.  I then tried the caps with the screw rod in the middle, my puppy had it disassembled and devoured in under 10 minutes (far less time than it took me to assemble).  Went back to the original caps and this time around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well.  Soon after, my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits.  While both of my dogs really loved it while it lasted, for the price of the toy and the price of the refills (which sell out from my local store so quickly I have a hard time getting them), for my guys, it just wasn't worth it, but for less aggressive chewers, this would be great."	3	0

-1	B000G6RYNE	A3L5L1NZIKLSJU	Kettle Chips, Sea Salt	"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."	1	0

1	B002BB2E14	A1KSP4V0KK06UW	Tasty and convenient!	I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old.  I wish I had found them earlier.  They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient!  I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about.  They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together.  They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies.  You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason.  Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8.  That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)	0	0
1	B000GZUBAS	A1ZQGAX40CFS46	Love these!	"I LOVE these as a snack for my baby, and use them mostly when on the go since baby can hold them himself.  I keep them in my car and offer them to him when shopping, in church or other errands.  GREAT for a stroller snack when on walks/run.  Rather than puffs where they go all over and he is always grabbing and vocalizing for more, these keep his hands and mouth busy for a good while.  And he feels grown up to be feeding himself.  They are ""individually packaged"" with two rusks/pack which is great, because like most good things one is never enough!  He always wants one more.<br /><br />Baby liked banana flavor just fine, but I'm partial to the veggie and since he likes them, and I always end up taking a nibble or two, I just get veggie now :)<br /><br />The only reason it is 4 stars not 5 is because mum mum + baby saliva = cement.  Best to clean his hands and pick up any dropped pieces before they get uber sticky and harden.  That said, once dry the pieces do chip off clothes or stroller/carseat material easily with your nail."	1	0

-1	B002IEVJRY	A2XSY4L7GDHV4W	Average canned coffee drink made with quality ingredients	The Illy Issimo canned coffee is a decent tasting coffee beverage, not stale or acidic tasting, but not flavorful or fresh enough for my tastes. I enjoy Cappuccino that is very robust and rich, but this drink tasted similar to the many average tasting canned coffee drinks on the market.  The cappuccino taste is very sweet with a hint of chocolate and milky flavors, but not rich and creamy (the way I like Cappuccinos).  There is also 18 grams of sugar, and the can is only 8.45 ounces.  The caffeine and energy I received from the drink was respectable, similar to a regular cup of coffee.  I do like the fact that the drink is Kosher certified, made with real cocoa powder and sugar (not high fructose corn syrup).  The beverage is also and not made from milk containing rBST.  Unfortunately, the product's taste falls short compared to some of the better canned coffee beverages I have tried.	0	0

I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!	0	0
-1	B001ELJK5U	A2OSTUT7PCW5G9	weak wine	I have made much wine with other brands with 100% success.  The other brand was pricey but produced very good product with high alcohol content.<br /><br />I decided to try Vino Italiano which was less costly and buying from Amazon was simple.  All batches were very watery and low alcohol.  I tried to improve the batches by adding fructose, fermentation enhancers, etc. with a resulting poor finished product.<br /><br />Today I went to a local wine making store and checked the ingredients and compared them to this product.  Both products used six gallons of water but the main difference,obvioulsly reflected in the price was that the product sold by Amazon had only 1.3 gallons of grape concentrate but the other had 2.3 gallons, thus the reason for the diluted product,cheap price and fermentation problems.<br /><br />In the final analysis, barring quality of the grape concentrate, I should have used 3 gallons of water and not 6 as the directions indicated.  Also, the yeast in the last batch I made may have been inactive or old.	0	0

I also love the flavor of cumin, I dont find it overpowering or over salty like some think.<br />I usually eat the whole packet as a dinner option and I get full off of it, I dont need anything with it and it satisfies my appetite.<br />For the price with the discount and the subscribe and save combined it cant be beat.	2	1
1	B0019KCUMG	A22CW0ZHY3NJH8	Great for lunchboxes	My kids love this milk.  I like that I can put them in their lunch pails and I can store them at room temperature in the pantry -- what convenience!  My kids prefer the chocolate milk best cold, so I keep some in the fridge, too.  It's a great way to get them some calcium and protein on the go.	1	0
1	B0000DID5R	AC7EVYSYRNNRS	ouch	this stuff is amazing. i used it in chili and it made the taste even better. i only put a cap of it into a 12 quart cooker and it was very hot. highly recommend.	0	0
1	B000H2259K	A2AR2UWWNKWY8M	Not a single lump and great flavor!	Southeastern Mills Gravy Mix -- whichever flavor you use -- is great gravy! Unlike most packets you get at the grocery that make one cup of gravy, this makes 3 1/2 cups. (So do their brown and peppered gravies.) What family only uses one cup of gravy? Not any family with southern or midwestern roots, I can tell you that. With Southeastern Mills, there is enough for the whole family and maybe a little left over for the cat or dog. (Maybe not.) Follow the directions on the packet and you will have smooth and tasty gravy every time. This is good gravy for chicken fried steak or breaded, boneless chicken breasts or, if you toss some browned and crumbled country sausage and a little pepper in it and cook the whole thing in the skillet you browned the sausage in, it is lip smackin' good on biscuits fresh out of the oven.	2	0

It's Good, Creamy Peanut Butter	"This is just like the smooth, reduced fat Skippy peanut butter you would buy in stores.<br /><br />These are the ""small"" 16.3 ounce size, but the price is a good deal - or at least it was when I bought it.<br /><br />Sure, even reduced fat peanut butter is not the healthiest thing on earth, but it's certainly healthier than some of the alternatives."	0	0
-1	B0002ARQYQ	A1U31XOCVZJFOW	Dog Cube	I like the food cube except it's not as indestructible as I had hoped.  I have four dogs and I bought this toy to see if I could curb my lab mix from her destructiveness due to mild separation anxiety.  Well, one of the other dogs figured it out first and taught her, the only problem is that the other dog also figured out how to pick the cube up to get it out of corners and this broke one of the plastic tabs inside that help you screw on and off the lid by pick it up with one canine in the hole and the other on the outside edge of the cube.  My 40lb dog broke the tab so what's going to happen if I were to let the 100 pounder play with it?  Thought this would be more like a Kong and less like rawhide that is easily destroyed.	0	0
-1	B002OMV09W	A3U6AAJ5TCCB2M	ghost is right...because i havent seen it	I bought this novelty plant about 2 months ago and I've got to say it sucks. Don't waste your money. I've read a lot about growing these chilis and I am doing everything perfectly including keeping the seeds/soil warm. I live in Arizona so warm temperatures aren't a problem. After a month of trying to grow the plant I contacted the magic plant company. They sent me more seeds which looked like the flakes you put on pizza minus the seeds. I planted them anyway. Another month later...and still nothing. I wouldn't waste my time with this. Go on eBay and buy the whole live plant if you want to have a ghost chili plant.	0	2

1	B001RVFDOO	A1OYZZ2727LASG	Popchips Does It for Me	"I was looking for a quality, low points (Weight Watchers (WW)), crunchy, salty snack.  I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a ""popped"" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life-long fan. ...until something better comes along."	0	0

1	B001BCXTGS	A2QDBOHV00NOR2	Cat's love it	"I got this new cat food after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, ""Feed your pet Right"". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine."	2	0
1	B003P9XG7M	A36PNZJBD369DX	Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Large Breed Senor Dogs	My dog, Petra, is almost 12 years old...she's a chocolate lab/chessie mix.  This has been a rough summer for her because her arthritis has gotten much worse with the heat.  Because of this, I switched to Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Large Breed Senior Dogs.  I've noticed much improvement in her energy level and her ability to get around since I switched.  I believe it has relieved some of her discomfort and she moves around better than she has.  I'm glad there's a product like this out there for my wonderful dog!	3	0
-1	B00474VPY0	A3KCWQMEOLRC2U	Nice smooth flavor - but not strong enough for me	Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee.	0	0
1	B002BB7EWI	A2Q5XBEY1EE6F6	Great for adults, too!	"I tried this product because it was a ""Friday Special"" and it caught my eye it being 100% fruit and 100% organic.  I don't have any children, but this looked interesting to try because I've been trying to eat healthier and sometimes it's hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day.  I buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before I can eat it all.  I bought the banana mish mash also, and really like it, too.  I like to add it to my oatmeal, or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast, or just by itself!  To clarify the ingredients- it has 3 different fruits, not just peach and not just banana.  Obviously, I'm ok with this...just wanted to throw that out there.  There are multiple things I love about this product.  Here goes.. and not in any particular order...<br />1) Easy to open, convenient, resealable pouch<br />2) It tastes great!<br />3) All natural, 100% fruit...no nasty preservatives or chemicals<br />4) 100% organic<br />5) Great for everyone, not just babies.<br />6) The price is good compared with other similar products, and I love the free shipping!"	0	0
1	B0094JPM1K	A2L72GWHIYQ34R	Great Product	I discovered this salt about 2 years ago and have not looked back. I love it. The Spice Lab gives you a high quality product for a great price. It is hard to describe Himalayan salt - you get more salty goodness without using so much. It is delicious!	2	0

1	B0009ETA76	A2O11TM0PSMB26	Great for runny noses!	Fenugreek has many different purposes and uses. The one that we take it for is either Runny noses or stuffed up noses when we start to get colds. This really works great. We will normally take Astragalus along with Fenugreek when we start to notice we are either stuffed up or have a runny nose. The two seem to work great together. The way that we use it isn't an every day vitamin, it's more of a 'when you are sick' vitamin. Depending on how bad it is, we will either take it once a day, or once in the morning and once in the evening.<br /><br />Hope this helped you out!	0	0
-1	B0060JMVM0	A15MRXRSRZMRKN	Bad dispenser tin design, oil is fine	The olive oil is fine, but when you open the tin for the first time olive oil gets all over your fingers and runs down the sides of the tin. It's so full that squeezing the can a tiny bit sends up a fountain of olive oil. One must wipe the side of the tin clean after each use since oil invariably drips down the side. So good oil, bad tin design.	4	2

1	B001H911SI	AJEIS6X5BJSDH	Try this before trying the real thing	I'm very glad I tried this product over shelling out the big bucks for the real thing.  I thought the taste was good - the olive oil was actually quite good - but a bit underwhelming for the hype (and cost) of real baby eels (at least in Spain).  Definitely worth a try though if you are curious!  Delivery was quick, packaging was good.  Just keep in mind that this is the size of an anchovy tin and shipping is more than the actual product.  Although still cheaper than the real thing, it's value is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I just can't give 5 stars to something I probably wouldn't order again.	1	0

1	B003OPCL5U	A3S2ZBMYNJ6WIJ	Yummy!	Great coffee with no bitter aftertaste and delicious pumpkin flavor. I used it in an eggnog latte and it was a hit in our house!  The only negative is that it doesn't come with a way to reseal the bag i.e. a tin tie or sticker. I used the tin tie from another coffee bag and that worked just fine.<br />If you like pumpkin and coffee you won't regret the purchase. While I did buy it during a lightening deal, I would buy again even at full price.	0	0
1	B000CQBZOW	A3FY3H6F4249E0	Different and Tasty	I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.	1	0

-1	B001E50X84	A3LQL2NYI9WTK	Occasional stem, wood piece or rock!	I was eating a handful of Sun-Maid raisins when I bit into a rock!  The description does warn against occasional stems or wood pieces, but I was sure surprised when I nearly broke my molars on a stone about the size of a raisin.  I wrote the company to see if they wanted to examine the stone or the package of raisins, but never received a response.<br /><br />These raisins are very tasty, but I have to give a one star rating based on Sun-Maid's poor customer service.  A solution is to eat them one at a time, inspecting each one prior, but what about oatmeal raisin cookies?  I am not sure I will ever be able to eat these raisins with the enthusiasm I used to have.	1	3

-1	B000WFRQQ4	A2DHA9BIS3NB2H	The only Welleness food my cat refuses to eat.	This is the only variety of Wellness food that my cat refuses to eat.  It is also the only variety that smells horrid.  Most of the varieties actually smell good, especially the chicken or turkey flavors.  This one is nauseating.  In fact, the first can I opened smelled so bad that I thought the product was spoiled and opened a second.  Now, either both were spoiled or neither were and it just smells horrific.  Too bad, as the product isn't inexpensive (though this Amazon sale is, perhaps because it doesn't sell well??).	3	0
1	B001E5E05G	A1426KH3FP7F1R	healthy and good	I rarely write a review on groceries. Books are my thing. But every once in a while a product is so great that you need to tell others. This is one of those times. It's not just great cereal. It's also a perfect snack when I'm hungry and want something a little sweet, but not crazy fattening. It fills me up and it's good for me, but it also tastes good. Great product. Natural.	2	1
-1	B001BORBHO	A2S3XL05JHEG6A	Developed problems after couple weeks	I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).  I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching.	0	1

-1	B001EO5S6M	APCDN1JK6B81P	Only if really, really hungry	I was introduced to these bars at a celiac conference, and later bought a box at a health food store. They are gluten free and they travel well. On the down side, they aren't good and I don't enjoy eating them. I will take them in my purse if I have nothing else, but I only eat them when really, really hungry and there are no other options around.<br /><br />I much prefer the gluten free lara bars for flavor. These may however be good for those with complex dietary restrictions like Celiac combined with diabetes. But- I wouldn't buy them again.	0	1
-1	B000E1695A	A1E2NE8NOLTSMT	Disappointing	Compared to other brands of instant soup cups, Annie Chun's Hot and Sour Soup Bowl is pretty darn good.  Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, this one is a major disappointment.<br /><br />The noodles are fabulous, and the veggies reconstitute very well, as with all Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking.  I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup.  I'm Annie Chun's biggest fan, so it pains me to leave a negative review, but the Hot and Sour is definitely out of my order rotation.	3	0

This is the 2nd time I have ordered annie's, shipping took awhile, but this time it didn't arrive at all. Amazon e-mailed to say it went back as unable to deliver. Welllll you have to get it to the right state first of all, then the correct town, before you can actually look for my house.. Duh. This time it went from Dallas to Commerce City,Colo. Then 4 days later it is signed for in Irvine,Tx. I hate to say, but Commerce city is still a good 300 mi. from my home town. Dhl here in town is also way lousy for claiming they attempted delivery, when they have not. They claimed to have attempted to deliver the last Annie's shipment i got, even had a time down, and I was home that entire day and never saw hide-nor-hair of their van. that time the boxes had gone to Salt lake City, then Pocatello Idaho, before circling around and finally arriving here. So be prepared to have it take awhile, or maybe even not at all if my experiences are any example.	1	20
-1	B000HDKZDC	A4WC07G97KYAU	Cost increased as size decreased	I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That's deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them.	0	0

It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day).<br /><br />I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told ""there's a problem"".  Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product.<br /><br />I ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace, but I am furious with Amazon.  NOWHERE on this page do they tell you there's a limit.  So I'm here to tell you there is.<br /><br />The food is great, but don't get used to buying it here."	16	10
1	B003VXFK44	A1X1SE0D8U0XDL	Yummy Coffee	I love the Wolfganag Puck flavors.  This Vienna blend is very nice.  It is medium roast so it is not too strong.  Has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee.  One of my favorites.	0	0

-1	B005CUU23S	A2CF66KIQ3RKX3	Too confusing for my dog	"I decided to try this ""treat"" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."	1	1
-1	B006HYLW32	ADVSW4W1HHYF7	So so	Normally I prefer plain chips, even though I don't eat them often. The chili lime is pretty good, great with some guacamole. These chips are very crisp, with a strong potato flavor, but also have a slightly burnt taste.	0	0

-1	B000F4F93Y	A3S15YGZ6W6EV2	What Are They Thinking?	"This is a very good, high quality mainstream Irish Breakfast Tea, something that will kick you in the butt to get you out of bed.  It's been described here as like ""stout,"" or ""Coffee"" and even ""strong enough for a mouse to trot upon.  I just describe it as kick your butt strong, and one heck of an astringent flavor.<br /><br />Amazon did so many things right when they offered this tea:  loose tea instead of bagged, which in my opinion, is the easiest way to prepare your tea and make it go from average to delicious.  It's a simple matter to take a teaspoon of tea and let it swim in the boiling water in your teapot. All the good stuff in the tea leaves comes out and you're drinking tea the way it has been drunk for thousands of years. If all you've ever had was tea in a tea bag, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Back to to the tea:  I always found that Irish Breakfast was harsh and astringent, and not at all pleasant. I always drink my tea black, and never thought to drink tea any other way.  You can't do with with Irish Breakfast Tea.  When drunk black, it's very unpleasant.  However, when cream is added, the tea undergoes a metamorphosis.  Besides the obvious color change and dairy tastes, the tea itself seems to change.  The harshness I detected when I drank the tea straight had disappeared, replaced by a rich, deep tea taste with a strength that gets you out the door in the morning with a smile on your face.<br /><br />Okay, you say.  Then what the heck do you mean by the title to this review?  It's because Twining's is selling their loose tea in far too large a quantity.  Six tins could last a family a year, and that's much too long to have tea kicking around.  Black tea is meant to be drunk right away, not stored in a kitchen cabinet for months on end, perhaps being opened, and certainly being exposed to heat and air.  The tea tins they sell are great for preserving a small quantity for the time it takes to drink the tea.  But tea kept for many months becomes stale and flavorless.<br /><br />If you do purchase this package of tea, keep two tins for yourself and give the other four to friends, making sure that they know this tea is meant to be prepared with cream and sugar.  The sugar might be optional, but the cream [milk] certainly isn't."	3	3

1	B005HV7TFG	A3POSTKRNE4YYM	Tastes good, but disfunctional pump	I love this creamer in my coffee.  However, reviewers are correct about the pump, and many many reviewers comment on its poor quality.  I can't imagine why the folks at the company don't get the hint.  Executives...what do you have to do to make them come to their senses?  Anyway, it will work for a while, but soon stops pumping all together.  It just gets gradually harder and harder to push the pump down, until you are leaning all your weight on it just to get the pump to depress.  I finally sawed through the top with a serrated knife and poured it into an empty water bottle so I can easily unscrew it and use.  I plan to buy a nice (empty) soap dispenser to pour the creamer into, and use it that way.  The above reviewers advice to freeze the extra creamer is a good tip that I will use.  I will just thaw it out when I need to refill the dispenser!	0	0
-1	B000YT7EF6	AROPFTWDVH5QM	From China?? Foreign objects found	One star for never replying to my email in which I included a photograph of a foreign object I found in the first package (looked like a dark brown chunk of foam, along with a hair). I was very much concerned when reading the labels' country of origin that among three, included China (Somehow I doubt that Canada beat out China for pricing = most likely China). Although I'll never know for sure since they never responded to any of my questions/concerns. I wouldn't recommend this product if your concerned about food quality.	2	1
1	B0045XE32E	A31RULW0KNYJ5H	Hardest cookies ever made?	These are apparently very tasty cookies. I have a Jack Russell mix and a Shih Tzu, and they appear to like the cookies very much.<br /><br />However, the cookies are like rocks. I have a difficult time breaking them apart even when they are meant to be broken apart. Each cookie is a sectioned two piece. It's impossible to break them apart further by hand.<br /><br />The JR mix finally succeeded in breaking down the cookie with his teeth. The Shih Tzu couldn't do it, no matter how hard he tried. Frankly, I worry he could break a tooth on these things.<br /><br />The ingredients look good (and they smell good), though I'm a little concerned about the palm oil--is it as bad for dogs as it is for humans?<br /><br />Even though the dogs seem to like them (I used a mallet to give small pieces to the Shih Tzu), I can't see buying them again. They're too much trouble.	2	2
-1	B000FQ0PS6	A2QUSVW7BTORBZ	You'd have to be desperate	A person would have to be very desperate to pay $25 for 2 twelve-packs of soda. A twelve pack in the store can be had for as low as $2.50 on sale, $4 worst-case. What's more, adding $45 for shipping is gouging in the worst way. If Squirt isn't available locally, you're better off buying some on vacation and taking it back on the plane with you.	1	4
1	B003OB2H1M	A2S7HFJI52FBSM	Good flavor	I ordered this flavor when I saw it was on Amazon, as most stores in my area do not carry it, and only carry Chicken, Beef, Shrimp and Oriental flavors. I guess there isn't enough demand for other flavors which is sad because the ones Ive tried that they used to have are way better than just Chicken and Beef. I enjoyed this flavor a lot. It is rich and satisfying. It does remind me a lot of roast beef, the flavor is kind of subtle, but is good all the same. I remember I used to be able to get this at the gorcery store and loved it and others such as Pork, Lime Shrimp, etc, sadly I now depend on Amazon for more Ramen variety. Thank you for carrying this and other Ramen, Amazon. I will continue to buy this and other hard to find flavors of Maruchan( like Creamy Chicken and Lime Shrimp, try those, they are delicious) for easy, tasty lunches.	0	0
-1	B002NHYQAS	A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ	Not remarkable	I really don't know what else to say except that it's moderate - not too bitter, not too sweet. The texture is not rich or exceptional in any way. It seems to be just a conglomeration of the ingredients listed on the package, so I would choose (or not) to get it based on whether you like that list.	0	2
1	B003ANFMY8	A1PIXUOG4BV8WU	My cat loves this cat food	My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently). I'd recomend it for fussy cats with tooth tartar problems (the chucks are larger than normal cat food and presumably help to clean their teeth when they crunch it). I usually buy the larger size for economy's sake, but this would be a better size to try out on your cat.	2	0
1	B002IEZJMA	A1ILWPH1GHUXE2	Not too sweet, with some bite to it - good stuff	"""illy issimo"" Caff&egrave; was a pleasant surprise to me after trying a similar illy product, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Where the cappuccino was a bit weak and bland for my taste, this Caff&egrave; had a reasonable amount of roasted coffee flavor and a bit of bite to it.  Like the other illy products I've tried the Caff&egrave; is only moderately sweetened.<br /><br />So if your preferred coffee drink is McDonald's or Dunkin Donuts iced coffee, this product is probably not going to appeal to you.  But if you'd like to try a premade coffee drink that's not overly sweet and actually has a bit of roast coffee flavor, illy issimo Caff&egrave; may be worth a try."	0	0

1	B005GRCWDU	AWGJ84989DSHN	Great Espresso, Robusta Causing Headaches	I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.	0	0

-1	B000HDI5OS	A1YWBCBMB0UBNV	Sure don't take like Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix	I am a huge fan of Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie mix.  One can of that and a can of evaporated mix and you have an instant pumpkin pie pudding or topping, no cooking needed because it is precooked when canned.  Libby's was swept off the shelves due to a harvest shortage this year (2009 harvest).  I bought some cans of this Farmer's Market pumpkin pie mix.  OMG, out of the can it's a very thick paste instead of slightly pourable like Libby's.  OK, that's a good thing, means it's richer.  Or does it.  I dunno.  So, I used a spoon to get it all out.  Added the 3/4 can of evaporated milk as it says to do.  Proceded to feel like a kid mixing flour and water to do some craft project while I worked it to try to get a liquid going.  Took a taste.  OMG.  Who dreamt up this recipe?  Is this stuff raw and not to be eaten without being cooked first?  It taste like molasses and pie spice.  It looks like molasses and pie spice.  It's brown instead of orange.  OMG, who wants to buy my remaining cans?  I got 7 left.  This stuff tastes like crap if you try to use it as an uncooked sauce like Libby's.  OK, so Libby's taste like liquid pumpkin candy pudding.  It might really be typical unhealthy American diet fare.  I dunno except it tastes fabulous.  This stuff tastes like medicine in comparison.  It probably makes a very good tasting pie.  Maybe I'll nuke my mixture for a while and see if the taste improves.  Otherwise, wait till Libby has another good harvest.	2	6
-1	B004MO6NI8	A2PBV1899CX3TE	How about a nice Hawaiin Punch?	No Fear tastes like Hawaiin Punch. Not impressed. I like Green Monster. That one tastes weird but I have a craving for it. Did I get a burst of energy? No. It didn't burst through my energy slump from 7 to 9 PM. Fell asleep watching TV. Again.<br /><br />I went online to find further information about this product. No Fear is a spin off of Sobe. Sobe name is derived from South Beach in Florida. They also make clothes. Skateboarding, surfing and Extreme Sports gear. Wetsuits. Their website focused on models for wetsuits. Couldn't get to the information on No Fear. There are actually websites/blogs that only feature reviews of energy drinks. I didn't look at them, to be perfectly Sinatra. Sobe was bought out by Pepsi in 2000. I am a Coca-Cola person. But whatever. I won't hold that against them. I heard that McDonald's bought out Chipottle. There was some truth to that, but more like both chains were owned by the same parent company.<br /><br />Coca Cola > Pepsi<br />Starbucks > McDonalds<br />Peets > Starbucks<br />Chipottle > Taco Bell<br />In N Out > McDonalds<br /><br />But, you know. Sometimes you're in the mood for a McDouble or a McRib. This is starting to remind me of Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction. Segue to Jim Carey in Yes Man. Because there is a really funny scene involving Red Bull and Zooey Deschanel! Which brings us right back to--<br /><br />The Bottom Line is Green Monster > No Fear!<br /><br />PS: They said it was a pack of 12 cans for review but they only send you one. Cheapskates.	0	3
1	B001E5E20O	A2YFCHH9PR70FE	The search stops here	Absolutely outstanding, if you like the aroma of Bergamot.  Despite the extemely strong aroma, the Bergamot flavor is not overwhelming (Taylor's aroma is milder, but its Bergamot flavor is completely overwhelming). Most Earl Grey is too subtile for me.<br /><br />Bergamot is probably a learned appreciation.  It is from citrus like a cross between an orange and a lime, with a powerful aroma and flavor of its own (inedible as fruit).<br /><br />You can still taste the tea, and it is great quality.  Add to this Fair Trade, Organic,and a great price, it can't be equaled.<br /><br />So if you like Bergamot aroma, and want enough Bergamot flavor to tell it's there, don't bother looking at anything else.	0	0

I just cannot believe that is gluten free, a real treat for people who want a nice cereal or something to add to a yogurt.I like also to add some nuts to this cereal, but the ingredients are of the highest quality and the packaging is really good at keeeping the granola frsh, a must buy.	0	0
1	B0002DGRPC	AJD41FBJD9010	best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them	Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%	0	0

Though this product, among a few others, was sent to me for testing purposes compliments of Influentser through their ""Summer Beauty Voxbox"" program, I would say that this would be a nice ""pick me up"" snack on the go. Moreover, though I did eat half of it, I ended up warming up the other half of the soft baked banana nut bread bar in the microwave (as directed) and it tasted good as well! With all that being said, is this my ""Holy Grail"" of snacks (I'm actually not much of a snack person to begin with) and I cannot live without it? No, BUT if I happen to see this in the stores and I wanted to pick up something, I would re-purchase this item due to it being a ""healthier"" option, a nice size (in my opinion) and the taste of it is quite pleasant."	0	0

1	B000LKZAAY	A118A49ORGNEUM	Canned Tuna	I have ordered this tuna on two different occasions. The quality is good (like big-name brands such as Starkist or Chicken Of The Sea), but the 24 pack is a little more convenient if you use a lot. I bought my tuna as a weight-loss device. This tuna fish is high in protein but amazingly low in fat. The only concern is that a high-fish diet these days introduces the risk of mercury exposure. Still, it's a great way to supplement your diet with cost effective and healthy seafood. Super healthy with brown un-bleached rice.	1	0
-1	B000F6UMHU	A237GXXJSSY893	A dissapointment	I had high hopes for these, especially based on many raving reviews, but I don't like them much. There is a very intense aftertaste, much like the taste you get from some artificially flavored/sweetened whey powders. It's amazing actually that I really love pretty much all the ingredients of this separately, but when they put it together it's pretty bad! They would be really satisfying as a healthy, high-energy snack ... if they just tasted a little/a lot better.	0	0

At $6.25 for an 8 oz. jar and $7.78 for shipping, this is a product costing over $14.  This brings the per ounce cost to $1.75 an ounce. This seems a bit excessive when you can buy Lump fish Caviar for only $1.92 and ounce if you have Prime shipping. Just saying.  Guess my guests won't be tasting this next weekend.	6	1

1	B001CEJ86K	A262I1DEN9V26E	Great canned Salmon..	I like to keep some fish in my diet but often find the choices at the grocery store to be disappointing. Although canned fish is certainly not as good as fresh I find this Salmon to be a great alternative to fresh fish. Sustainably caught, wild, and packed without any extra fillers makes this can a winner. Only complaints is that the cans I have received are not pop top as they are in the picture and I have received one order so far that had a dented can. If you do receive a dented can though be sure to contact Amazon as I quickly received a partial refund on this order when I spoke with customer service. In any case, highly recommended, as this Salmon not only tastes better but is also simply better for you. Definitely worth some extra money.	2	0
1	B000CMHMUC	A4DYFZYOJAX3K	Not too shabby!	I have a very bad habit of snacking that I can't get rid of. So I purchased this to make snacking a little less bad. The first time I tried it I was like UGH it's gross! But soon it started to grow on me. It's very crispy, without being a deep fried potato chip. It's lightly salted, and doesn't have 12 different fattening, unhealthy seasonings and flavorings. One entire bag is only like 350 calories. It's actually quite good. I really like it now, and I find myeslf reaching for a bag of GenSoy before any type of chip.	0	0

I will be ordering more as soon as I can. I don't think the 16 oz jar is going to last long.<br /><br />The math is wrong the 16 oz jar isn't 26 cents an ounce more like 55 cents an ounce. I wasn't buying it based on price, I was bought it based on reviews. This had the best reviews and I now know why. I am glad that it came in a glass jar, after talking to my friends, the plastic containers will alter the taste of the oil. So for a pure tasting coconut oil, I wanted to make sure the one I got came in a glass container.	0	0
-1	B000BY50BY	ARCCUJAZQZMRQ	Really stinky	These are really stinky.  Not a problem as far as the dog is concerned; most dogs would be hard pressed to decide if they wanted to eat or roll in four day old road kill, after all. I, however, am thanking my lucky stars I have an airproof tin tub to store these treats in.  The strips are also irregularly sized and shaped.  Again, the dog doesn't seem to mind, but, given the smell, I would prefer not to have to poke thru the bag looking for a large piece when I want to keep the dog occupied for a while.

"I ordered this ""caramelo de coca"" thinking it was the common candy found in Ecuador.<br />The brand that I used in Ecuador to cure my high altitude sickness was in a light green<br />wrapper with a brand name KESHUA or KESHWA ? The wrapper did not stick to the candy like<br />the caramelos I received in my order that seem like they were wrapped in somebody's back<br />yard or quaint kitchen. The one from Ecuador ( labeled as a product of Peru ) was a pleasure<br />to eat, but the one I received in my order was frustrating to eat.<br />If this firm ever gets the brand I mentioned, I would be happy to reorder as it helped me<br />for high altitude use in Ecuador and in the Northern mountains of New Mexico."	2	1

It's very smooth and spreadable, with a nice, very lightly-spiced, sweet taste. I must say, I have tried other brands which were OVERWHELMINGLY autumn-""spicy""/nutmeg-y, which I didn't like as much as Kauffman's. It's so good, in fact, that I can't wait 'til the fall and need to order another jar. My family enjoys it too. Also, the company was very warmly responsive to inquiries by e-mail.

I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"	1	0

-1	B003VTNBQ2	A1EFBWSEIHNCD7	Poor Quality Product	When looking at buying creamer, I mistakenly believed that this product would pair well with the coffee I enjoy (a cinnamon / vanilla flavored coffee).  Listed below are my opinions about said creamer when used in both normal coffee (unflavored medium roast) as well as flavored coffee.  Both types of coffee were ground that day.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The amount of creamer you receive borders on the ridiculous.  The package has to contain near 8 lbs. of creamer.<br />The creamer is individually packaged and arrives in four cartons (each containing 50 creamers).<br />The cartons are easy to open and have a flap to allow for easy access.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The creamer is VERY weak.  To receive the same texture / coloring / flavoring as a traditional creamer (one in a bottle), you must use roughly 50% more of this creamer.<br />The vanilla taste is very minimal.<br />The cinnamon taste is very prevalent.<br />the cinnamon taste is rather repugnant and almost has a sour taste to it.<br />The individual creamers are rather hard to open (not that they are difficult to grab the flap, but there is a ton of glue used, and most often (7/10 times) will tear because the flap is glued down to heavily.<br /><br />~~~~<br /><br />In all, I would not recommend this product.  I've actually tried to give the creamer away to several people, but after tasting it, no one wants it.  Even at work, with the ~175 remaining creamers sitting there, after a week, the first container is still not empty (meaning, that of the 175 I brought, there are still more than 150 sitting there).	0	0

-1	B001FA1E7M	A19WFV820DD5FC	I wouldn't purchase it again	It was OK, but nothing to rave about.  I generally eat a lot of chocolate and candy, but the thought of eating more than one little bar of this stuff every couple of days is not at all appealing to me.  It just doesn't taste good enough to justify buying it in this type of bulk. My advice would be to spend your money elsewhere.	0	1
-1	B0013A0QXC	A1055XEY360CG2	Better coffee from a can	There's no denying the Senseo is easy to use, and 'greener' than any of the other pod brewers out there. But the Dark Roast coffee was stale and dry, with the same aroma and flavor of a canned coffee that's been left sitting out too long.<br /><br />A pod brew will never be AS GOOD as drip - I get that. But that won't stop me from looking for something close.<br /><br />If you want easy and are not picky about taste, this pod's for you. If you want a pod brew that is at all reminiscent of a decent cup of coffeehouse java, keep looking.	0	3
-1	B001E5E1PA	A1JRYSAA9AZOQK	Vegan, but NOT organic	Being a frequent soy milk purchaser, I kind of assume that they're all organic (almost all of them are) and didn't even think to check when I ordered this product.  Unfortunately, Better Than Milk is NOT organic, meaning that I won't order it again.  I also thought it was bland and very thin unless I doubled the amount of powder suggested.	1	0
-1	B0001ES9F8	A3TC56TG1M3DOD	Expensive now!	When in the hell did this coffee skyrocket it's prices??<br />Previously we had bought some for the same price as all their other flavors (around 36 bucks or so).<br />Now this medium roast is over 95 dollars for the same thing?? WTF?!<br />This just totally stops me from ever getting this brand again.<br />Heck, it's cheaper in the long run to switch over to another style of coffee maker (with the small cups)<br />and forego this.  I don't know what caused this price increase but I am willing to bet it will kill sales.	5	1
-1	B001KUQG3O	A14G19CEDCKJZI	GROSS	I tried to give this this 0 stars but I had to give it at least one.  This stuff is so nasty.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter but a bit like soy sauce.  Three of us tried it numerous ways, on toast and crackers, with jam, etc, and couldn't get over how awful it was.  Anyone who says something good about this product probably works for the company.  I'll take a jog and eat real peanut butter before I save a few calories or fat grams and eat this stuff.	6	0

1	B001KUWDMW	AH6CIFVOD1332	Love Candy Cane Lane	This is my favorite holiday tea! I love this flavor even more because it's not just a strong peppermint!

It's so yummy this tea tastes just like a candy cane! And since it's decaf I can drink this anytime of the day! My local grocery store was selling these so I bought a few boxes to last me through winter! But the more cups I drank the more I loved it! I went back to back to the grocery store to stock up year round but they were already sold out :( I'm so glad I can still get this on Amazon!

I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?	4	0

-1	B000F3N7AC	AFDU8YM3P3RP2	Good Item But Costs TOO MUCH!	"Sure, Splenda is a good sweetener and I have bought it here in this quantity in the past, but it costs TOO MUCH here, and I especially feel this way when I went right now and found it at the samsclub website for half as much.  Now of course, samsclub sucks because they won't ship it, but we have to pay shipping here too, so why can't the price be half as much also, or at least comparable to that?  I would even be willing to buy the generic version of Splenda, (sucralose + maltodextrin + dextrose) ""Altern"", but that isn't offered here either, but if it is in the future, IT SHOULD ALSO BE AT LEAST HALF THE PRICE, or more realistically, 1/4th just like it is in real life.  Anyway, I am sorry, I just wanted to gripe a little.  Sweetener should not be only for rich people.  If they were to charge that much for sugar (which it is, look it up on Wikipedia), I'm sure lots of other people would have a heart attack also (not just me).  :P  6/10"	4	1
1	B007TJGY46	A2I24UZNBCF9NR	Worthy of my morning cup	"The Keurig machine is unbelievably convenient, but I find the majority of K-cups are simply weak and unpalatable. I always buy the coffees labeled ""bold"" as nothing else cuts it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is a decent cup of coffee. It's not quite the body of a drip brewer, but comes pretty close. Close enough that I'm not inclined to schlep out the drip brewer and spill coffee grounds on the counter and wait 10 minutes before I can have my wake up beverage.<br /><br />One other thing - the cups are just loose in a big box, so you will want to have a basket or other container to put them in."	0	0
1	B002SSIQZI	AUGW5H5OWN6BQ	Great	This is the only food we have ever feed our now year and a half old cat. Liliath is strong, happy, healthy with an awesomely shiny silky coat. Her potty never smells, she is never gassy and also she has only ever had 1 hair ball. I started feeding her Natural Balance LID when she was 8 weeks old because I had fed the doggy version to my lab who had allergies and he loved it and I wanted to feed our new kitten a high quality cat food that I knew she would never have issues with. Liliath is so picky she even turned her nose up at some Fancy Feast a friend tried to give her. I love that with this food it feeds them their entire lives...no need to ever switch from kitten formula to adult.	0	0
-1	B0007A0AQW	A2PX2INC17AK2	Salmon Treats have strong smell	Sadly my dog is NOT fond of these even though she does like salmon and anything smelly! She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?)

I would say that this comes in a close second. I made it according to directions and then stirred in a small can (about 6 oz) of cooked white meat chicken. Made it a little heartier. I would buy this again if Alessi wasn't available.	0	0

-1	B000ER6Y54	A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	Our twin 7-month olds love this one - carrots	I subscribe to the 4 oz. version of this baby food.  Considering price, I think the 4 oz. jars are a better deal.<br /><br />Both our twin babies love this one with carrots as we discovered with the vegetable variety pack.  Other parents have told me their babies like carrots so this one is likely to be a winner.<br /><br />I've tried many Earth's Best baby food in the jars products on my babies.  They like all of them with only a couple exceptions.  I've discovered they're not fond of peas or onions, but I've also discovered that as they get older they will eat more types of foods.  If you get something your baby doesn't like, maybe you can keep it on hand for when your baby is a few months older and try again.<br /><br />Several other varieties of Earth's Best contain carrots.  I think this is to make them sweet so that babies will like them more.<br /><br />The ingredients are simply organic carrots and water.  One 4-ounce jar (not this 2.5 ounce jar) has 40 calories, and daily value: 4% protein, 150% vitamin A and 4% calcium (that's all of it; no iron for example).<br /><br />Compared to other Earth Best varieties, this has very little calories but is very high in vitamin A.  I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.	0	0

I made the mistake of looking at the picture and spotting ""nougat,"" which really shouldn't be *that* chewy.

This chili is thin, and has ingredients like cinnamon in it.  I know must people that I have told about this chili, upon their first taste, have not known how to think about it.  I normally get ""its different"".  But after the second and third times, they have all bought their own cans and love it now.<br /><br />The best way to eat this is in the classic three-way style.  Take some spaghetti and place it on a plate. Add the chili on top of the pasta and add a nice helping of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Enjoy a four or five way by either adding beans or sliced onions, or both!<br /><br />Top a good natural casing hot dog with the chili, a little mustard and the cheddar cheese and you have one heck of a chili dog.<br /><br />Im getting hungry now after writing this, and I think I am going to go make some Skyline!"	0	0

And the salt free version uses something in place of the salt which seems to make it really bitter. Apparently no happy medium. Make your own greek seasoning, lots of recipes all over the web.	6	3
1	B000CQBZOW	A1UQBFCERIP7VJ	Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea	Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.	0	0

Ate one and immediately felt nausea, kept burping a methane like smell which made me feel like I want to throw up. My family could handle the smell, took out the trash which I ditch the wafer into. Husband walk by and almost threw up from the smell. What an cookie event that was. Don't get me wrong, Garden makes great chocolate wafers which I totally enjoy.

-1	B001EQ5IU6	A2JF46VL3ALR5B	Unfortunately too good to be true...	"I bought Chocagave based on the rave reviews and ""healthy"" claims (based on being organic, raw, and using ""natural"" sweetener). It really is very tasty as a chocolate syrup and excellent for making hot chocolate. It's fairly liquid, so drizzles well on top on dessert, while not being watery (for example, I think Hershey's syrup seems runny as well as tasting yucky).<br /><br />The unfortunate part comes in the ""natural"" raw agave syrup used in this chocolate. Yes, I'm sure it's organic and raw like the maker claims BUT I've recently started reading about how UNNATURAL agave nectar really is. Agave is apparently a created sweetener concocted sometime in the 1990s by manufacturers using the same process as high fructose corn syrup, except with the starchy part of the agave plant rather than corn. As a result, agave nectar is made up of same unhealthy fructose (a higher percentage than high fructose corn syrup) that experts claim increases obesity, insulin resistance, etc, etc. (You've probably heard the arguments if you're looking for more natural sweeteners because you do believe high fructose corn syrup is bad).<br /><br />So, fructose might be a low glycemic sweetener, but I'm disappointed that the healthier alternative chocolate syrup that I bought isn't as healthy as I thought it would be. Sure, it's chocolate dessert and should be used in moderation but I was not aware that agave syrup being a ""natural"" alternative is mostly hype.<br /><br />Know what you're buying and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH on whether this is a good choice for you. It might be great for a diabetic without any other good options (since I think fake sweeteners taste funny and are probably even unhealthier). For me, I don't think it's really worth the additional expense to buy something I know isn't necessarily any healthier than organic chocolate with real sugar."	12	4

In addition, because he licks the bowl clean there is never any bits of food left that has to be scraped off the plate.  Also, since it smells like canned chicken it does not give him funky cat food breath and mi gato is a face licker so this is a plus.  Only downfall is cost, at his weight he would need four cans a day which is quite expensive so I feed him a mix of no grain dried food and the Weruva canned.	1	0

-1	B001EQ4OWO	A18F2DU2IZVZ3M	Regular Size is Too Small	"The nice thing about the BioBags is that they open easily (the sides don't get stuck together), and that they are biodegradable - although, I'm not sure how beneficial the latter is if the bags end up inside another non-biodegradable bag, e.g. in the town park.<br /><br />The problem with the BioBag (regular size) is that it is only 7.4"" wide, as compared to 8.5"" for the Mutt Mitt and 10.7"" for the Pooch Pick-Up bag. (All measurements are of one side of the bag, when it is opened and laid flat.) Instructions show you putting your hand through the bag and picking up the poop, and pulling it back through the bag. Unfortunately sometimes it is a tight fit to get your hand plus the poop back through this bag. If the poop is on the messy side, it can easily touch and stick to the inside top of the bag, and then maybe to you. (My experience is with a medium sized dog, but I think you could have the same problem with a small dog.) I find myself being very careful pulling the poop through, and I have sometimes had to put the dirty bag inside a second bag...then get out some sanitary wipes for my hands.<br /><br />The BioBag has from 1 to 3 dime-sized holes near the top (not sure why the hole punching seems to be inconsistent), so you can use one as a carrying handle by looping it over a finger. The actual purpose of the holes are so that you can pull through the other side of the bag as a way of closing it."	12	1
-1	B000PJMRWU	A2EUS9D8AIM847	Skip these! . . . Quite Horrible	"My husband and I love the ""regular"" (with sugar) Miss Meringues when we do the Weight Watchers diet as the cookies are incredibly cheap in WW ""points value"" and provide a few tasty sweet bites. These Sugar Free ones, however, taste nothing like the regular ones and are really quite horrible . . . including a gross texture that gums up in your teeth when you bite them (nothing like an actual meringue) + a bad taste. Skip these! (If I could've rated this product 0 stars I would have.) They have no redeeming qualities."	8	3
1	B007M83302	A3MFU0GVZUVH3K	I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!	"These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of ""Dream Reachers"" series of books (with Chase Von)"	1	0

-1	B0012V1G0Y	A2ECEIX9OOX6T7	My Dog Loves It but It's Not Perfect	"I have a very smart, often bored Australian Shepherd. She's about 40 pounds and I'd consider her a moderate chewer. She's not really destructive, but if she wants something bad enough, she makes it hers. We affectionately call this her ""puppy crack dispenser"". She brings it to us to fill up when she's finished the discs and she's PUSHY about it. To say she's addicted is putting it mildly. It keeps her attention for an hour or so at a time, which is a godsend. Right there, it makes this purchase worth it for us. As a matter of fact, we've just bought our second one. Which brings me to the bad...<br /><br />In no way is this an everlasting sort of toy, not in the ball part and not in the disc part. The first one we got her lasted for about 3 months of HARD use which really isn't bad considering the abuse it's gone through. We've replaced it now that little bits of blue plastic have started coming off and now that she can pry the discs out way too easily. Just as it started to get easier to put them in, due to use, it meant it took her WAY less time to get them out. The refills are just too expensive for three hours of entertainment when it would take her a couple of days to pry them free when the ball is new.<br /><br />Also, the slits in the middle to insert smaller treats open too wide to make it much of a challenge for my girl to empty it, so we skip that part.<br /><br />Overall, the fact we've replaced this toy when it started to wear speaks volumes. She loves it and we love anything that keeps her happy and distracted from her velcro-like tendency to stick to us when we're trying to cook or putter around the house."	0	0
-1	B0016AXCAS	A2BP2UXTAGEQTM	Suspicious ginger from China.	"I had purchased this ginger once in the past, and it was very good quality. However, the latest order that I made gave me quite a shock! The ginger powder had a very peculiar, chemical odor. I tasted a small sample and had to rinse my mouth as it was disgusting. Then I looked more closely at the label, and discovered the problem. This ginger is from China, and although labeled as organic, I'm quite sure that it was laced with pesticide or other chemicals. I have read reports of ""organic"" ginger leaving China literally covered with insecticide powder, and I suspect that this is what may have happened to this batch. I would recommend that you avoid this product until these issues are resolved."	21	1

I am babysitting a neighbor's dog; his elderly wife is unable to handle him (while he is older, but overweight - now getting back in shape); her husband is now in a different Assisted Living Facility Home for Therapy before coming home. I have 2 differing Purina's brand, one which he practically went crazy over (that which my cats thought were their food) - with 2 cups in 2 different bowls ... he did not like this one at all. Added some warm beef broth and made a gravy with this to see if he would eat it, instead, he flipped the bowl over completely and made a mess. He did not like this period - dry or gravy-like. So I went to my neighbor's house who has a Mixed-Breed Peki-Terrier; and the Owners put him down and at first he tilted his head ... oh he practically devoured it! When added with a little warm water for a gravy-like treat; he just went literally nuts!<br /><br />Took this down for some other Dog Reviews:<br /><br />Down to the neighbor's around the corner:<br />Rotweiller: Snubbed it instantly without any hestitation<br />German Shepherd snarfed it up and ate the Rotweiller's too and wanted more!<br /><br />Went to another neighbor's home who has 3 dogs:<br />English Bull Dog: Did not like with or without gravy mix<br />Pit Bull Mix: Unsure at first; after a few bites - then gobbled it up with tail wagging but wanted to play rather than eat.<br />Greyhound: Wasted no time trying to eat before it was poured into the bowl first! *laughing*<br /><br />Another Neighbor's House:<br />Brown (light) Chow-Chow: tipped bowl over and walked off<br />Black Chow Chow: YUMMY! Even ate off the ground that his sister tipped over and begged for more; tail was wagging like a mad maniac!<br /><br />Last Neighbor's House:<br />Great Dane: finished the entire bag off and stuck head in bag looking for the last kibble, was disappointed; tail was wagging like crazy!<br /><br />There's your Dog Reviews - pretty much most of the Dogs Loved It while a few didn't.	2	1

Not a huge fan of Kellog's Raisin Bran for a variety of reasons:<br /><br />1. Relative to other flakey cereals (Special K, Total etc.), the flakes are sometimes not always fresh (I don't know about Amazon's batch) and it really makes the cereal sort of gummy and yucky<br />2. In general, the flakes themselves, even when fresh,a re not real crunchy (admittedly, they are bran flakes, not pure rice, wheat or corn flakes, so they seem more like a bran fiber cereal) and they get mushy in milk pretty quickly.<br />3. Amazon used to have a four-pack for nearly the same price, so this is not a big savings anymore with the three-pack (pricey NYC stores typically always have Kellog's Raisin Bran on sale and it's usually $2.99/20 oz box).<br /><br />On the plus side, I DO like the raisins. They're plump and not sugary coated.	0	0

I tried  again a few weeks later with the same results.<br />I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste.  His cat had the same results.  No deal.  He  then put some out for  four ferral cats  he was feeding . NO takers.  It is hard to believe that not one  of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..<br />I would not try this food unless youi needed some cans to hold up a bookcase.<br />If looking for a premium chicken try Instinct. A bit pricy but my cats love it. I also learned not to fix a good thing.  Cats are not like  humans and don't seem to mind the same food everyday.	7	7

-1	B007RTR898	A1OD5F83ZA8O95	Nice shampoo, Smooth hair	I have color treated, below shoulder length hair.  My normal shampoo/conditioner is Paul Mitchell<br />I got both the shampoo and conditioner through the Vine program to try out.  I tossed them into my workout bag and have used them for the past 9 visits to my gym.<br /><br />The shampoo lather is creamy and seems to clean fairly well, it sometimes felt hard to rinse out competely.  It seems quite concentrated and so I started using less and less of it over the trial period, so that might be a good thing to be able to use less.<br />The conditioner feels thick and smooth.  It does a good job of coating my hair all the way down to some of my damages places.  I wouldn't call them repaired, but they were coated enough to smooth them out.  It doesn't seem overly heavy or sticky, rinsed out fairly well and my hair felt silky and slippery (just the way I like it after a shower)<br /><br />I prefer to just let my hair naturally air dry and curl the ends later.  I never blow-dry.  These products are excellent in the fact that I didn't have any puffiness or flyaway problems after it dried.  My wavy areas seemed to be smoother and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  My hair turned out to be very soft and smooth looking.  Nice to touch and comb.<br />I did have a bit of a problem with my scalp being itchy and a whole lot flakey after the first few uses, but that has stopped, so there was definitely some changes going on there from this product use.... hopefully for the good.<br />Bottom line is that I like both these products.  They smell really great, and the price is very good for what they do.  I may update this review when I get to the bottom of the bottles.	0	0
-1	B000K8CPCS	A3523E6PAOPLZW	Made coffe sweet	I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste.  I don't like sugar in my coffee.  Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away.  There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners.  Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.	5	0
1	B000PNIPPO	A1CS5AG4HH9SAV	great munchies	I love this variety of Chex mix. Unfortunately I can't find it in the grocery stores anymore, but was excited to find it on Amazon. The caramel bits are especially yummy.  I fell in love with it before I decided to diet, and now that I'm on Weight Watchers, I really appreciate finding 100 calorie snacks that taste great.	6	0
1	B0083QJU72	AC6TC5IILQPLR	The best	If you love waffles, pancakes, and french toast like I do then you might not want to cheap out on the syrup.  This is the best tasting syrup I have had at home and the container lasts a long time.	0	0
1	B001NZPFB0	A1431FE27RXUEN	dogslove dogswell	Because of allergies to wheat and corn I decided to give Dogswell products a try. This is the first dry dog food my dogs will eat without adding gravy or meat or veggies or leftovers and they do so eagerly. It smells good enough for me to eat and they haven't scratched since they started on this product. Amazon's price is cheaper than I can get locally so not only is the food good, it's a bargain at that. I love you Amazon!	7	0
1	B00016AU3K	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Delicious, Yes, May Help With Stress Relief	"****<br /><br />This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, ""Your breath is the voice of your soul"" and ""Your head must bow to your heart"".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. ""Kava-kava,"" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of ""relaxed unconcern"" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.""<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, ""Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.""<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />****"	3	1

-1	B007JFMIWW	A3KDO3XV0MK1GX	Mediocre taste and nutrition stats.	"I enjoy eating breakfast bars when I'm in a rush and want something light.  Unfortunately, this Quaker Stila Bar did not live up to my expectations.  The center is blueberry flavored, but I did not get a strong blueberry flavor (it instead had a purely artificial flavor).  I didn't care for the texture either (if you want something crispy, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317HLQA"">Special K Fruit Crisps, Blueberry, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />The nutrition does not make up for the mediocre taste.  It's only 100 calories per bar, which isn't bad at all, but there are only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber.  From my breakfast bar, I'd prefer a bar with more fiber and/or protein, to ensure I don't get hungry quickly."	0	0

1	B00469LR94	A3TD1O4EC26NT2	Perfect for College kids, only needs water... but...	Perfect for College kids, as it only needs water, but... what I never considered was the MENTALITY of my college students... what **I** thought would happen was for many small cakes be made out of the 5-lb mix.<br /><br />well... the box on its side has instructions on how to make the mix.  the entire mix in one BIG cake.  and that is what they did.  one HUGE cake, and one monstrous mess in one trashed out kitchen with one very sad (but wiser) mom shaking her head.<br /><br />Great things about this mix:  1.  only needs water added, all other ingredients are already in the mix.  2.  you can make any size cake you want and save the balance of the mix for future baking endeavors.  3.  it bakes up into a very light, yet moist cake.<br /><br />Things to remember:  1.  the bag inside the box is NOT resealable, so you will need to find some way to seal a container or large ziplock baggies to keep the balance of the mix fresh and bug-free.  2.  college kids will make the whole cake mix at one time and dive right in.  :)	0	0
-1	B0017WFX6G	A2QNFX54CBKSX3	Is this just vinegar?	I bought this to help get rid of mineral deposits in my dishwasher, luckily, not to eat,<br />but it smells like nothing so much as vinegar, which is mostly acetic acid, not citric.<br />Vinegar helps with the deposit problem, too, but, relative to cit*rus*, it stinks.  I don't<br />know whether it is of benefit to plants, and it surely seems concentrated so maybe<br />it's in a handy form, and I know vinegar contains some citric acid, but people should<br />know that's what they're getting.  I really don't know how to rate this, because it doesn't<br />do much for my purposes (I was already trying vinegar in the dishwasher), but I don't<br />know what it's really supposed to smell like, and I don't know how *not* to do a star<br />rating.	1	2

-1	B000FDLBLY	AXSDD92JCDPV7	Not Spanish sardines anymore	"*****NOTE: See update at bottom<br /><br />These sardines have a rich and delicate flavor, enhanced by the mixture of olive and soy oils in which they are bathed. It is truly one of the few instances I have found where something that I really like also happens to be good for my health, so needless to say I eat them quite a bit.<br /><br />Like one of the previous reviewers say, you could pay double and get some brand of Portuguese sardines, but you would be wasting half of your money. Instead, pay the same and get twice the little fish!<br /><br />On one occassion I ran out of these sardines so I got a different brand in Safeway. I was shocked at the difference. To start with, what is branded as ""sardines"" in the U.S. is rarely actually a type of sardine, but rather some other small fish. After getting used to this brand, however, the taste of those other ""packed in the U.S.A."" sardines was very bad. So bad, actually, that I couldn't finish the can and ran to the computer to order another batch of these.<br /><br />*****UPDATE (8-5-2012)<br />Vigo has decided to stop sourcing these sardines form Spain. These sardines are now from Morocco and the quality is far worse. The fish themselves are far smaller, they break apart easily, and have overall a gelatinous consistency and fishy smell. It is a pity. I suppose that it was a cost cutting measure. I will have to start looking for an alternate source of true Spanish sardines.<br /><br />The 1-star review is due to the fact that the product is now misrepresented (the picture still reads Spanish sardines.) If not for that, I would give it 2 stars."	0	1

1	B0030ZLOUC	A2LML806QEXDN0	pretty good	just recently started buying this for our 2 rotties, one is almost 2 and the other is ~16 months. we have tried other brands, (wellness, 3 different types of Iams) and so far this seems to be doing the best.  my oldest seems to have less issues with allergies, their coats have gotten softer (my older one is almost back to his soft puppy coat) and the younger is not nearly as gassy as he was (especially on the wellness, not a bad food, just seems to effect large breeds this way). they are in no way finicky eaters so that wasnt a problem and switching them took no time at all. they have been stuck inside more than usual lately so i dont know how its effecting their energy yet. id give it 5 stars but it is a little expensive, though the cost is about what we paid for the wellness large breed.. so far seems to be worth it. i would recommend at least trying it..	0	0
1	B0026RQTGE	AHRJEVNHM7W3R	love those greenies	I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.	0	0

It's not $7.00-for-a-candy-bar-good, that's for sure.  You can't really even taste the bacon.  If you gave a piece to someone and didn't tell them there was bacon in it they would likely never guess there was.<br /><br />Now on Amazon it's 12 dollars!?  That is a very bad deal.

I love the combination of the pepper and the honey. You wouldn't know it was honey; it just adds a little sweetness. I wouldn't have liked a strong honey flavor anyway. It also has a smell that I really like. You have to try it. If you have to pick one kind of Buffalo Bills, try this one first.	0	0
-1	B007Y59HVM	#oc-R2ZARZZGRIU309	Chasing the Fog and Forgetting the Bug!	"I have been drinking coffee for over 40 plus years now.  Folks, I have tried so many varieties from Instant to Drip to K cups, and the list goes on.  Hopefully, the reader gets the picture...I love my coffee.  Yet, I am not sure what this ""stuff"" is.  Here is my experience...<br /><br />First, I get the shipment.  Open it up, and I must admit, I do like the nice box the coffee arrives in.  I do appreciate the added note on the box from the Robinson Family along with their mission statement.<br /><br />""Taste the Difference - Make a Difference - Community Aid Program"" and there is more information on the side of the box which really sort of made me ""feel good"" about my purchase.  The Robinson Family goes on to state ""Offering the best value to you, our customer.  Treating our employees, suppliers, and customers as if they were part of our family.""  I mean all this really made me feel good and I was glad I had purchased a product where a ""family"" supported others...<br /><br />Yet, that is where it ended.  I opened the box, cut open the plastic sealed containers this ""cups"" come in, and grabbed my first little strange looking but new looking ""k cup"".  Please note, as others have said, these are completely different than an actual ""k cup"", but I thought unique and liked the design....<br /><br />UNTIL...yes, UNTIL...I hate to write this, but the very first thing I noted on the side of this ""bag cup"" was something that looked like a bug!!  It politely dropped in the palm of my hand, and since it was not ""wiggling"", I figured I could examine it very closely.  I did....<br /><br />YUCK!  It was some sort of freaking small, slim BUG!!  I thought maybe it was my ole' eyes, but had my son examine it and he confirmed my verdict....<br /><br />Did I go ahead and try the coffee???  Well, again, I hate to admit this, but I figured the bug could not ""kill"" me, so yes...I went ahead and tried the other ""cup"" things (honestly, I don't know what to call these little cups"").  My first reaction was just ""disgust""...The flavor was weak and the cream and sugar simply diluted to the bottom of the cup.  Nothing like the Rev K Cups or other K cups I had used...<br /><br />So, I went to the computer to write a review...no, not today I thought...I wanted to be fair, because, again, I felt a part of the ""Family"" the manufacturer had written about on the box...and maybe the ""bug"" was still in my mind!<br /><br />Thus, here I sit today several days later, and just finished another of these cups....and after using a few of the things...I just honestly cannot understand why all the high positives written by other reviewers?  Honestly?  I am trying to like these things due to the price and the ""Family"" caring thing...but, this coffee is simply too weak and does not taste like ""coffee"" to me.  In comparison, it sort of reminds me of an off the wall instant coffee on the weak scale...<br /><br />Folks, all of you who have written such positive reviews...trust me, I want to be open minded...I want to like this coffee.  I tried smaller cups on my K cup machine, and it simply gets worse...<br /><br />So, in conclusion, maybe I got a ""bad box""?  I mean should there have been a ""bug"" in it to begin with??  Even with that...get past the bug issue...where is the flavor?  Why does the cream and sugar simply dissolve to the bottom of the cup leaving a bad looking residue as you get to the last sip?  It dissolves ""into the coffee"" with other brands...<br /><br />I love the price, and wish I could like this...is there another type other than the ""Fog Chaser""???  Would like to stay with the Robinson Family, but not left in the ""Fog"" as this is sort of how I feel trying to drink this coffee .....""Fog Chaser""????  Well, I am definitely ""chasing the Fog""...trying to understand how this is called ""coffee""????<br /><br />I will continue through this box the best I can, and ""if"" I find one of the cups different, then in all fairness, I will update this review to treat the ""Robinson Family"" fair...And yes, I guess maybe I am crazy to drink through all these things since the bug was on the first one, but I figure the hot water should kill any harmful bacteria...hope I am right??  But, again, I want to emphasize, it is not the ""bug"" that is causing my dislike of this ""wattery, weak...very odd coffee""....."	1	3

We are big fans of coconut water and have replaced all other drinks with it at family and other social gatherings.  But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type #7 (unidentified plastics created after 1987, including the plastic type BPA!) and even more puzzling, the bottle lists another plastic type next to it saying its also a #2 plastic type but its HDPE compatible.

-1	B000AYDFUI	AAQMDSR9B2EDR	The worst protein/meat substitute product I've ever tasted	I bought a 12-pack of Redi-Burger about three months ago after reading the previous reviews. I have tried numerous Loma Linda, Worthington, Morningstar Farms, Boca, etc protein or meat substitute products over the past 30 years, but this is without doubt the worst of them.<br />I ordered this product for shelf storage during the winter months since my freezer space is limited and thought it would be convenient to occasionally open a can to slice for burgers, or chop up for use in tacos, chili, casseroles, etc. I expected the quality would be similar to other Worthington and Loma Linda canned products. I have tried to use this product in these various ways for several months and it's just horrible and can't be disguised even in other dishes. I'm going to donate the remaining cans to local meals program. The problem is the taste and texture. It tastes burned right out of the can, and has a sandy/gritty or mealy texture that doesn't help. After much consideration, I would describe the taste as a concentrated, burned hamburger bun that caught some of the aroma or seasonings of a hamburger or veggie burger along the way.<br />I love Worthington and Loma Linda's other products and would quickly recommend them such as the canned veggie sausage links, Tender Bites, Burger, the frozen Morningstar Farms and Boca burgers, sausage and crumbles, etc. Redi-Burger though is so bad that it could make a vegetarian reconsider eating meat.	7	2

The ingredients in this food are really not something I would normally even consider feeding to our cats, but like I said, I was freaking out! Usually cats like crappy canned food, so I figured, what the hell and opened a can. Not only did our chronic renal failure cat turn his nose up, but so did the other 3 cats. Oh, well!

-1	B000VK8HCW	A145IN9FBZNSL	Guess I won't buy again	My dog seems to like this just fine and dandy. She's happy to eat it but I don't like the fact that it is so mushy. She's not a big dog and it takes her forever to lap the food up. Yes, I know, it's probably good exercise having to work to eat her food but I don't like to have to work to eat my food so I don't want her to either.	1	7
-1	B0006MWNQ6	A1C0UCSKLZR0I9	Made Cat Sick, Cost $200 to Fix, Company Wouldn't Reimburse	I purchased a bag of WellPet's Wellness Complete Health (blue bag) dry cat food at a local pet store.  I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem.  The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure.  The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200.  I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem.  Please advise other customers of this potential problem so they don't waste their time and money on the product, or cause their pet to become painfully sick.	1	3

1	B002DHSECY	AJ8MAJ82OK3G1	Great for early mornings	These are great for a quick & filling breakfast. The cinnamon flavor adds a nice twist to the original. The cereal pieces are more on the crunchy and thick side in terms of texture. The little heart shaped pieces are a nice touch.	0	1
-1	B003H7YHUW	A2XJ04D0UPVGNP	Great Tasting But Disappointed They're Packed in Vietnam	I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna.  The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna.  It simply can't be beaten and, they use BPA free cans which is very rare in this country.  Thanks to another review on Amazon, I discovered that many of the canned goods I was buying for my family that were organic, were also packed in cans coated in a lining that includes BPA.  I did some research and discovered Wild Planet.  Their tuna and sardines are more expensive but it's worth it because all of their products are sustainably caught, and packaged responsibly.  They're good for our planet and great for my family.  The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is because the sardines are processed in Vietnam and not the US.  The tuna is processed here. The sardines are not, and while I'm sure the canneries used are monitored by Wild Planet, I would much rather serve my family something that was packaged in this country giving fellow Americans much needed jobs.  I also think that with the price of the sardines, they should be packaged here.<br /><br />Anyway, if taste is your only concern, buy these sardines.  They're the best I've tasted.  If you care where your food is processed, these might not be for you--altho, no sardines are processed in this country anymore so I guess we're just out of luck. For some reason, we Americans don't seem to care that we now make very little in our own country.  Go figure.	13	8
1	B0006VB3TA	A3JKRRYQEE3WEM	Dog toy that REALLY entertains!	I have two golden retrievers who can chew their way through any treat in no time...not so anymore!  The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste, their teeth look great, and they continue to play with it right up until they get the last bit of treat out.  When the package says your dog will be busy for hours, they aren't lying.  I'm sold on this product and am busy stocking up on refills to keep my goldens happy.	12	0
-1	B000J4EPGW	A2YZ3098P45ZMG	Worthless!!	Lots of good reviews led me to purchase this product. I ignored the bad reviews feeling that they were a minority, an unlucky few that ended up with a poor batch.<br /><br />Well, here's another dissatisfied customer.<br /><br />I used 1, 2, 3, and then 4 bags of this stuff and all it did was make me feel slightly like I had a cold.<br /><br />If you are like me looking for a bit of a stimulant, forget it. As for the other health properties ascribed to this tea I'd say it's no better than cabbage.	0	1

-1	B0000DGFCO	A3NLRIXYK42YHR	Arrived as described, but poorly trained.	"Regarding the Seller - The tree was packed very well, and arrived according to the description.  There were a few dead leaves, but I expected this.  The seller gets 5 stars.<br /><br />Regarding the Tree - I have several complaints about the tree.  First, whoever was trimming the branches did an extremely poor job.  The trunk was filled with ""knobs"" from branches that were cut off.  This happens when straight scissors are used to cut the branches rather than the appropriate concave branch trimmers.  I'm no expert at growing bonsai, but even I know this very basic principle.  I would expect the person who grew and trained this bonsai to understand it too.<br />Second, the tree was very very lopsided, almost to the point that it would tip over at the slightest bump.  This will be easy to fix when I re-pot it, but it is still annoying to have to deal with.  On a related note, the pot that it arrived in was very nice.<br /><br />Bottom line, I would recommend getting a bonsai at a local store rather than online.  The picture of the bonsai in the listing is like the picture of a Big-mac on the menu... that is, the big-mac you get doesn't compare to the picture, even though it contains all the ingredients."	0	0

-1	B000SDO5YQ	A2LIO34ZSX3K4E	Makes colored water in my new Ariete Espresso Machine	Regretfully, these pods don't work in my brand new Ariete Cafe Prestige espresso machine.  All I get is colored water.  Yuk!!<br /><br />I know the pods are the problem because the machine makes wonderful espresso using the coffee beans I roast at home.  I had hoped to use the Lavazza pods to avoid the mess of using loose coffee grounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying 150 of them from Amazon and now I can't return them.  I tried using them to make American coffee but the results were just as bad.  I also tried cutting the pods open and using the ground coffee inside to make espresso.  That didn't work either.<br /><br />What a dissappointment.	1	5

1	B002NHYQAS	A30ODR6WBE61UB	"My new favorite dark chocolate bar, organic and ""slave-free"""	I tend to prefer darker chocolate -- 65-70%.  So I was expecting this 54% bar to be sweeter or creamier, thus not entirely to my liking.<br /><br />I found this bar neither waxy nor chalky, as some of the darkest chocolates can be. Neither is it quite creamy. Rather, it melts very slowly in my mouth, leaving none of the bitterness of some dark chocolates and none of the filminess, either. I guess you'd call it a clean finish!<br /><br />Neither my palate nor my reporting skills are entirely sophisticated when it comes to chocolate. I can't pinpoint the flavor as being like that of any tropical or tree fruit. And, like most people, I have my preferences and so my opinion is highly subjective.<br /><br />What I can say is that I like this bar very much and will be interested in the other bars in this Newman's line.  I also like patronizing this brand, as they do so much good work through its non-profit efforts.  I also like the fact that it is organic and that, as best I can determine, this is slave-free chocolate.  That is worth paying a few cents extra for, in my opinion.	0	0
-1	B001ULH7P4	A3N4VTNFPMTHEF	More like rice cakes than dried chips	The back of the bags state that they're 100% dried fruit, but they aren't like any dried fruit that I've had before.  Each chip feels like a rice cake or rice cracker, with a light, puffy texture.  This makes it really easy to eat a bag very quickly, which apparently contains 1.5 pears, 1.5 apples, or 1 banana and 4 strawberries, depending on which flavor you grab.  The strawberries are pretty similar to the ones that you find in Special K with Strawberries, but they're even lighter.<br /><br />I don't think they're terrible, but I can't say that I love them either.  I'll finish my two boxes of 24 and probably won't be ordering these again.<br /><br />If anyone is wondering, here are the nutritional facts:<br /><br />ASIAN PEAR:<br />Serving Size: 1 entire bag<br />Calories: 40<br />Calories from Fat: 0<br />Total Fat: 0g<br />- Saturated Fat: 0g<br />- Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carb.: 9g<br />- Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />- Sugars: 7g<br />Protein: 0g<br />Vitamin A: 0%<br />Vitamin C: 2%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 0%<br /><br />FUJI APPLE:<br />Serving Size: 1 entire bag<br />Calories: 39<br />Calories from Fat: 0<br />Total Fat: 0g<br />- Saturated Fat: 0g<br />- Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carb.: 9g<br />- Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />- Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 0g<br />Vitamin A: 2%<br />Vitamin C: 3%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 0%<br /><br />STRAWBERRY / BANANA:<br />Serving Size: 1 entire bag<br />Calories: 45<br />Calories from Fat: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g<br />- Saturated Fat: 0g<br />- Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carb.: 10g<br />- Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />- Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 1g<br />Vitamin A: 2%<br />Vitamin C: 41%<br />Calcium: 1%<br />Iron: 2%	3	1
-1	B001VJ0B0I	A7RFDGVXDYQLJ	Poor Quality Dog Food!	I was excited about feeding my Golden Retriever and Bichon this food since it is touted as being so healthy, but after reading the ingredients I realize that it is NOT so healthy.  Ground yellow corn is the first ingredient!  What about all the veggies on the front?  I prefer to feed my dogs food that has  meat as the first ingredient...real meat!  Dogs are carnivores and need some meat in their diet and not just ground corn , chicken by-product meal (whatever that is) and corn gluten meal.  Not for my dogs!  A very poor quality dog food.	0	2
1	B000P4Y8E0	A2E7E9EWADK4S6	Honey, yum....	Crunchy is the key word here.<br /><br />I purchased these snack bars because they don't contain the usual bugaboos: high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, etc. However, they're mighty hard to chew. And that's *probably* a good thing.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore fan of Quaker Oats granola bars, because they're a quick snack and they're heavy-laden with sugar, but they also have the HFCS (bad, bad) and hydrogenated oils (bad, bad, BAD). However, they are easy to chew (probably because of the nice, soft plastics they contain). I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.<br /><br />I'm working my way through the different flavors. My favorites are the pumpkin spice and peanut butter, yet honestly, I can't discern an enormous difference between these three (pumpkin, PB and honey toasted).	6	0
-1	B004R8L71W	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Just o.k. with a bit of a bland taste - and actually not so bueno on the health!	"While my family is not major fans of mac and cheese I always keep a couple boxes of the stuff around for food emergencies and/or teen groups. In general we prefer the Kraft brand to other brands or generic but honestly I sometimes mix in a box of generic or two. Times are tough.<br /><br />We found this one to be very bland. For the amount of sodium, fat, and calories I expected far better. The veggie parts are not significant enough once you hit those fat and calorie levels to justify it. We didn't hate the taste - but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it either. Its probably a bit healthier than regular M&C but that's not really saying much. Overall - I'd buy it on sale but would not go out of my way otherwise - and if the sale included the regular M&C I'd buy that instead. It's not quite at the ""take a pass people"" level but it's not far off either."	0	0
1	B0043ODAAG	A1MVZMBVCRYK9S	consummate coconut convenience	Potassium punch in a pouch - an envelope of electrolytes - this stuff is awesome.  I love my coconut water daily and was horrified at the waste I was responsible for as a result.  This product is going to be my new favorite regular amazon purchase until I can find it in my local stores.  The flavor is fantastic (as is the plain - sadly for me I had to knock a star off the Pom-Ras), the dissolvability great, and the convenience can't be beat.

-1	B001G0MG0A	A1ARWWN26Q2XP5	Why the change?	Reading older reviews is a trip down memory lane. This decadent delight WAS a favorite. My wife and I would squirrel this away, hiding it from the amazing sniffer of our 12-year-old daughter, this was a treat we looked forward to with great anticipation. Then sometime several months ago the packaging changed. Well, at least we thought it was JUST the packaging, but to our horror, that was not the case. Ghirardelli tossed aside the recipe of our beloved chocolate and went with a new recipe that was dreadful. Gone was the aroma and texture we'd come to love. And the raspberry seeded filling that gave honor to the oft-disaffected raspberry was just some gooey-jell fake with no tribute to the old favorite as it became nothing more than a distant memory. Suffice it to say that after the weeping and rending of cloth, we won't get fooled again. Bring back the old stuff, Ghirardelli, else we shall turn our passions forever to the Lindt in our pockets!	3	2
1	B002ZOPTYQ	A8QRQIG7O4CIM	Like Home-Made	"Let me begin my review by stating that I have been a Helmann's mayonnaise devotee for the better part of my lifetime. I have tried many other brands, mainly out of curiosity, and found all of them inferior. Recently, a friend recommended Blue Plate brand. To be honest, I had never even heard of Blue Plate Mayonnaise. To my surprise however, on a recent trip to my local Publix, there it was, in an unassuming blue, yellow, and red container, tucked away on the bottom shelf. Given my frequent disappointments, I was skeptical to say the least.My fears were soon put to rest, however.<br />  Upon first taste, I immediately thought of Helmann's. Blue Plate had a nice, slightly acidic tang that I was familiar with. There was no sweetness whatsoever. The Blue Plate had a nice clean aftertaste, and no heavy off-oil flavor, common to many lesser brands. (Even the much vaunted Duke's brand, which I tried with high expectations, let me down in this department. It tasted heavily of cheap oil.) While the taste is very similar, where Blue Plate is leaps and bounds ahead of Helmann's is in the texture department. For those of you who have ever made home-made mayo, you are familiar with the wonderful, velvety texture that is created. There is a nice sheen, and a good white (not yellow) color. Blue Plate reminded me of this exactly. Unlike Helmann's, there is no ""whipped"" thing going on here - very little air in the mixture, which added to the outstanding, home-made experience. I can see why Blue Plate has been a staple in Cajun Kitchens for the better part of a century.<br />  For those of you who take your Mayo seriously, I strongly recommend Blue-Plate. I really believe you will not be disappointing."	1	0

The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!	0	2

This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.	0	0

-1	B007OSBEV0	A2R28IOP06EH4X	No Consistency	I purchased the variety pack of Martinsons and the Brown Gold they are both from the same vendor.  I did not like the taste of the Martinson product at all.  I threw it away, not the product I expected at all.  The Brown Gold was more palatable, however certain flavors with this brand also feel short in particular the Costa Rican named product was extremely too bitter.  I would agree with most that this does give you a lower cost per serving, but when the coffee is inferior and the taste match is also, I think the best descriptor is cheap.	0	0
1	B000CSCOXQ	A3FY3H6F4249E0	Pretty good snack	"I tried one of these and thought it was pretty good, but not enough for breakfast for me.  I don't eat a lot at one time, but it wasn't that filling.  Maybe with a piece of fruit and a drink it could be breakfast. (Honestly, I prefer the chocolate peanut butter bars from South Beach Living--awesome).<br /><br />Anyway, this vanilla crisp cereal bar is 90 calories, 2g protein, 10% niacin, thiamin, vitamin B6, and riboflavin (again, compare it to the South Beach Living Peanut Butter Chocolate bar). The vanilla crisp bar is tasty, a little sweet but not too bad, and crunchy like a rice krispy bar. It has a drizzle of what tastes like white icing on top. It's a lot better than many of these bars.<br /><br />If you are eating these as a low-cal snack or to have something in the car to keep your sugar count from blitzing out, then ok, sure.  But if you are doing a diet thing, you need to have a satisfying meal experience. If you feel ""cheated"" out of breakfast, you are likely to go off your diet.  Most diet gurus tell you to eat 3 - 6 reasonable and satisfying meals a day. And as someone who lost 59 lbs 1-2 years ago, I agree.<br /><br />By the way--bars contain wheat, milk, and soy ingredients. (I know some people are allergic to these ingredients.)"	1	0

-1	B0038B1DEU	A3MKRM2Q9F04UH	Great nutrititious drink for kids	"I bought both the Berry and Chocolate drinks for daughter; however, she preferred the berry since it is sweeter.  I love the facts that it has a rainbow selection of vegetables and fruits some of which my daughter doesn't like to eat like spinach and sprouts.  Like another reviewer, I am also not thrilled with the fact that the powder drink contains ""Natural flavor"" which could mean msg.  When I approached a sale person at a major health food grocery store, he didn't even know what natural flavor is.  Since we ran out of the powder, I am hesistant to buy this same drink and feed my daughter because of the ""Natural Flavor"" ingredient.  It will be while until I find a good wholesome powder drink for my daughter since originally I planned to replace this drink with her vitamins' intake.  I give 3 1/2 stars since it has the natural flavor ingredient."	4	2

-1	B001TLY7BM	AKYQ59VS0B38Q	cat food	The photo presented by a reviewer convinced me to buy this product. My cats are very picky and only like pure products: chicken, salmon, with nothing in it. I thought it would be a pure chicken product with lots of liquid, which my cats LOVE..... However,  although it is a moist product, I think the can adds a taste that makes my cats dislike it. It is less costly and more environmentally friendly product than the fancy feast Appetizers that are in individual plastic servings but not of the same quality.	2	10
