		A81RNLAPAAEBE	Great quick cup of coffee	I drink Starbucks drip coffee. The instant tastes just as good, and is great when you don't want to make a whole pot. Friends could not believe they were drinking instant coffee.	0	0
		A3QTYFG670Y67T	Swedish fish...my sweet addiction.	I am not a big candy eater. In fact, I try to avoid sweets for the most part. But, Swedish Fish are my addiction. This package of 3 really doesn't last long in my house. They are red, sweet and chewy.	2	0
		A3NL2F3TA3NAEV	Did I get the same coffee?	Maybe I received the expired batch from five years ago, but this stuff is tasteless. It takes two K-cups to make a normal strength cup of decaf. I wonder if Emeril samples the products that bear his name? I will avoid his picture from now on! Timothy's decaf is just great- I'll stick with that I guess.	0	1
		A26X2GWXKOC1UY	Now Bad, Was Once Good	This used to be really good tea. For two years we drank it and really liked it.<br /><br />The last two batches have had some kind of sludge that comes off it, so much so that it cloggs the filter on the coffee maker I use to brew it. (The same one I've used for years.)<br /><br />It would be good if we had a way to contact the manufacturer so we could alert them that their good product just went bad, from one month to the next.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Frustrated Green Tea Guy	5	0
		ATPJXNNT5HXYP	best home taco mix	By far the best home taco kit you can get. I  tried all the other ones you can find in local stores and not only is this one better I don't like the other ones.  It is a combination of the mix & shells having a strange taste to them.  Most local grocery stores don't seem to be carrying this anymore so I have them delivered every 3-6 months automatically depending on how often we go through them.  Taco night is one of my 3 year old son's favorite nights as he gets to make his own taco!	1	0
		A2LCL68JZ5W8LU	Slim Six Rocks!	I picked up a box of each Slimstix cocktail mixes:  Margarita, Mojito, Cosmo.  They all are great, but my favorite is Mojito. I was amazed and the ease of use. If you just muddle a little fresh mint and lime to this, No more having to worry about Simple Syrups etc and the its perfect, you would never know its sugarfree. As a Long time Mojito drinker the<br />drink mix is spot on and with the fresh fruit the only thing you are missing is the calories.<br /><br />They all have their own distinct style, Margarita is sweet/sour, Mojito light mint / lime, and Cosmo more sweet / fruit taste.  There are some great recipes on the website that you can create just by muddling in lime and other low cal ingredients.  Portability factor is great too.<br /><br />CL	4	0
		A15T084PULS6HY	REALLY GOOD!! Tase amazingly good for peanut butter cookies!	excellent product and cheaper to buy here as opposed to the stores. so far my fav cookies to eat because they aren't as unhealthly as some of the other products. ... subscribe to get the discount	1	0
		A11ZJ3X8ZJTALM	Disappointing	I bought it as a substitute for powder Stevia hoping for better after-taste.<br />I am disappointed. The dropper design is faulty and I can't get drops in the coffee with out getting some on my fingers - an avoidable waste.<br />I also found that one needs to use more than a few drops to get the sweet taste.<br />The powder form is more economical if somebody makes half-packets of powder?	0	0
		A1AY4QM3FDINBQ	Good!	I ordered these after a friend brought some stroopwafels back from Holland. While these are pretty good, they didn't seem as fresh as the ones my friend brought back from Holland.	0	0
		A2OTO7TH9F433R	Could stay a little fresher since vaccummed sealed	Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness.  A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste.  I would not purchase them again.  I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness.  Also the sticks get very hard.	1	1
		A1SU0YX7XIPZB0	Loved it	This was a great gift for myself, I told my mom about it and she wants a 1960's one, she loved the idea of having her favorite candy again.	7	4
		A2YOGNVPB3GJQJ	Give it two days, just as good!	"I've been drinking Carnation Instant Breakfast (the original) for most of my life.  It took me about two days to get ""used to"" drinking the no sugar added version, and now I actually prefer it.  It saves me some calories and isn't quite as heavy in the mornings."	0	0
		A10NIIWUHCDI0Q	Excellent Lebanese coffee!	I and my wife are frequent at Lebnan Zaman, our local Lebanese restaurant, and we always get coffee with cardamon. Now we can make it at home any time we want.	1	0
		A22Z3RZ040GL35	Great Treat	My dog loves these treats.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they should make some larger size ones.<br /><br />I have a border collie/lab mix, about 75 pounds, and he just gulps these down.<br /><br />We still give them to him, as they really do help his skin problems.<br /><br />From our experience with other treats, if they were larger, he would chew them and enjoy them more.	0	0
		A2QL1GR1A49HXK	excellent price/package and delivery	Rec'd package 4days earlier than expected. Nice, easy to open. excellent- use before date on package and price compared to other around MN area/hard to find in my area. Brewed up a cup and had good flavor to it and would recommend if interested in bold flavor coffee. tracking of package was easy to use and free shipping on three items.  definitely would tell friend about this. price is $22 for two packages not bad price don't pay any higher(not worth it)	0	1
		A2NHGV40QUL4BL	Terrible Don't Buy	I've tried all the flavors. SK Engery has a Terrible Taste and Doesn't work. There are way better energy shots out there SK sucks.	0	0
		AKVZR7FIDF0TU	disgusting	Got this at Costco three months ago because it was cheaper than Lipton and we go through green tea. It tastes too much like mineral water with a slight tea flavor. And it has a bad after taste. We have been drinking it off and on since we bought it and are still not half way through the package of 35. Not recommended.	0	0
		AM17ARD119DYN	Not true rice paper	These may be a great product, but they are not true rice paper. The ingredients listed (in order) are tapioca, filtered water, rice flour, etc. The only ingredient in real rice paper is rice.	3	2
		A2L84KIT7PAZ0J	Did I get ripped off?	I was supposed to get 2 boxes of Jelly Beans in this package - but only one came.  So I paid $12 for a single little box of Jelly Beans?  Can't get in touch with the shipper to get another...not feeling good about this purchase.	3	1
		A2V9DTXTQ5YIMK	Perfect Saltine and size!	It feels odd to write a review about Saltines but I found a need for these. I usually get the other size saltines that are bigger but when I saw the smaller size I immediately ordered them. I have had them for a few months now and use them several times a week! I love that you can just put them in a bowl or cup or soup without having to crunch them up first. They are also a perfect snack size to munch on if your tummy is feeling a bit upset or you are on a bland diet. Nabisco has always been my favorite brand for Saltines whether they are the bigger size ones are these. But if I had a choice I would stick to these for the size and convenience. They are very crisp tasting and not too salty. Just the right amount of a saltine cracker to satisfy whatever need it is you have. Highly recommend and will be ordering more!	7	0
		A1080VOU32OCLY	if you like HOT food and i mean HOT!	This is incredibly too hot. I only use a quarter of the packet, and I can't see anyone eating this completely without really REALLY liking spicy food. i expected, idk, mild? but that's not the point; it was hot to the point that it actually RUINED the taste of the noodles.<br /><br />i think im going to stick to Nissin and Maruchan...more Nissin, i think.	2	8
		A3QQRMRZHPXRAH	cant believe I can have such a good lunch at work	I bought the 12 pack and keep it in my locker at work- Make a pot of rice, and you will feel like your at an indian resturant. I'm no expert on indian food, but I like this and with the spicy zip it is much better than a balony sandwich.	1	0
		AAK35FLHLF298	BEST K-CUP!!!!	"Fair warning: if you are not looking for strong coffee, this isn't for you! This blend is much strong than my previous favorite ""black tiger"". While it is strong, it doesn't have the bitterness that you get with coffee from other k-cups or Starbucks. It has a nice sweet taste that is perfect for those who take their coffee black (tastes great with milk, cream and/or sugar too!!!). I have recommended this blend to a few friends who bought it after I gave them one to try. Try and you won't be disappointed."	2	0
		AKH4BTY3E72VJ	Now shipped from Bayside candy	"I ordered these toffee nuts from the superior nut company often. I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it now says ""shipped from Bayside Candy"" when I ordered them this time around, and honestly I wouldn't have cared. That is until my order arrived today! These nuts are very dark, almost burnt looking, barely covered toffee (The toffee looks dark and burnt anyway), and they taste GROSS!!! You can't taste any butter Toffee...or better yet it taste like someone over cooked it and burnt the batch!<br /><br />The nuts that you see in the picture are no more!<br /><br />Why on earth did this company think it was a good idea to switch those light colored delicious large BUTTER TOFFEE nuts you see in the picture with these tiny BURNT looking and tasting, barely covered in dark burnt toffee peanut PIECES is beyond me. I so want my money back!"	0	0
		A2RMNJIITGW45H	Faint smelling.	"Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, ""Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical."".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks"	1	0
		A2ZE8KMRGKARPJ	high fructose corn syrup	I stopped using this years ago because of the high fructose corn syrup. high fructose corn syrup comes from GMOS . A new study done on gmos has come out and its showing rats that were fed GMOS developed large tumors.<br /><br />Companies like Heinz are pushing UN agenda 21 .<br /><br />Buy some good real sugar Organic ketchup it tastes the same and is only a few cents more .	0	1
		A1G782BND72233	dog toy	My dogs have enjoyed this toy but they lift a flap and try to rotate to toy to get the treats versus lifting each individual flap. Sometimes they get one or two treats then lose interest.	0	0
		A1ND4DZS3KBG8O	regular stuff	I don't find this vanilla extract to be particularly strong (it's ok but hasn't impressed me with its flavor) and would not buy it again. I was attracted by the organic label but have since done my reading and now understand that the vanilla flavors are extracted in alcohol. Thus a really good quality extract will have a high alcohol content. And from an ethical standpoint, I probably should have been looking for a fair trade label rather than an organic one.	2	2
		A2HGUNLVHJYSCW	Just right	Not too dark, not too light, not too harsh and not to caffeinated.<br />Makes the perfect cup of coffee. Bought from Amazon and received in 2 days with Prime. Great price too.	0	0
		A2L13D1K3PF717	Human-grade ingredients - Awesome!	This is amazing cat food and it's incredibly affordable. The company says that the ingredients are human-grade, which I think is wonderful. I don't like that there are so many ingredients (and some are questionable to me, as I don't know what they are without a bit of research - ex. dicalcium phosphate) but I think it's far superior to most cat food on the market. The ideal diet would be a cat's natural food or the raw food cat diet, but if you don't feed your cat that, this is a good cat food to choose. I think it's healthier than other brands and there are no grains!	1	0
		A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP	Organic...	I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil. Only EXTRA VIRGIN, the first round of olives that have been pressed have the 200 antioxidants, not refined or mixed with other oils. I keep the oils in the freezer, away from heat and light all the time. Bravo.	7	3
		A3E5PHPXUU0T58	Great food, but...	...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.	4	1
		A1KZK7XGXDJVJQ	Smells good...	This coffee smells amazing when brewed but is so weak that all flavor and aroma is lost if you put anything in it. I was hoping for a little more boldness and wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes medium or dark roast coffee because they will be sorely disappointed.	0	0
		AHYRTWABDAG1H	No massage was offered by Ms. Deen!	"I bought this service with the hopes that Ms. Deen herself or at least one of her employees would come out to my house and offer the service indicated in the title, a ""Butt massage"". No, I don't expect anything erotic or anything like that before someone makes such an accusation, I simply put have a sore tush and from time to time need someone to massage it so it's not so tender and painful. Now, did I get said service! No! I instead got two 2.77 ounce shakers of spices. Well, I decided that maybe this isn't the butt of some joke and figured maybe the idea was to ""self serve"" if you will, to massage my own behind with the spices. I did this, and I developed a rash the next day! I will NOT order this product again.<br /><br />The spices would probably be okay on pork though. But I don't own any livestock to massage so for me that is moot.<br /><br />As an aside, this is a cut and paste of my review of a different size of Ms. Deen's butt massage service, thus the reference to two 2.77 ounce shakers.  Even so, given the only difference is the size of the jar my comments there should apply to here fine."	1	1
		A39LURR2WD1FLL	Felt it was needed.	I felt it was needed to review this cat food because it is getting one star reviews that have nothing to do with the cat food itself.<br /><br />The cat food is great cat food, the cats love it. They cant eat it fast enough. The price is fair.	0	0
		A1ZSJNSRZCNCS1	It's Like a Good Chili!	I bought these not sure what to expect.  When I tried them, they taste just like a good chili without the vegetables.  This makes these beans great side dish to a vegetable or whatever.  These are a nice option in addition to the regular Eden beans, which are the very best beans.  Not to mention they are BPA free.  These are very good, as are all Eden products.	8	0
		A2W1X3H67481N9	yummy	I purchased these in preparation for a visit from my niece who is gluten intolerant. Wow, was I surprised! These are really crunchy and delicious! I would definitely buy them again for anyone. It's a great product.	2	0
		A21C5CR95LT0ZY	Great flavor, but not for sushi.	This rice has a wonderful flavor and texture. However, in the description it said it was great for sushi. Do not be fooled. Short grain rice makes the best sushi as it stays together very well.<br /><br />Though when cooked properly this medium-grain rice is STICKIER than the long grain variety, you may have difficulty trying to make any recipe where it is necessary for the rice to stick together.<br /><br />If you like rice to be somewhere between sticky and separated, then this is perfect for you. If you're looking for a good brown sticky sushi rice, stick with short grain.	2	0
		APVU6ELDPPFNU	one month of use made a nonbeliever out of me	In reading all the reviews of different decaf k-cups, the opinion I came away with was that Tully's was where I should go to get a really bold, dark roasted flavor similar to Starbucks' coffee. It does get closer to Starbucks than any of the other decaf k-cups I have tried. But in a way it goes too far and results in a somewhat strange and overpowering taste.<br /><br />I had tried Timothy's decaf and Newman's Own decaf, with the latter vastly superior to the former. I would say Tully's beats Timothy's (which is just brown water), but probably not Newman's. I also tried Donut Shop decaf simultaneously with Tully's (I had Donut Shop at work and Tully's at home). For the first few days, I thought Donut Shop was a little weak and I liked Tully's better for its bolder flavor. But after a couple of weeks I grew tired and a little sick of Tully's strong taste - it's not just strong like a normal cup of Starbucks, it's strong almost like they added some kind of artificial chemical to it to make it taste darker or more burned than it really is. After one month I was long done with the Donut Shop and was just slowly getting through the Tully's (diluted with lots of milk).<br /><br />When I reordered, I only considered Newman's or Donut Shop. I couldn't bring myself to drink another cup of Tully's. It's a shame because they definitely took a step in the right direction with their stronger flavor, but it was a misstep that makes the coffee a poor choice for long-term consumption.<br /><br />Perhaps a good strategy for a newcomer would be to order Tully's AND another brand or two like Newman's and Donut Shop, and trade off which one they drink. That might make Tully's flavor less grating over time	1	1
		A1TIVD0Y3KJSCN	Excellent, truly is low acid!	"I never buy pre-ground coffee, we grind our own; however, I was tempted by the ""low acid"" offer, since I often have heart burn when I drink coffee.  I was extremely surprised with how GOOD this coffee tasted. Seriously, I had very low expectations, and I was blown away not only by the fact that I had less heart burn, but the taste was great!  It not only didn't taste like ""low acid"" coffee, it didn't taste pre-ground.  That said, I was reviewing the prices for the low acid coffee, and it is waaay expensive.  Not sure I'll be buying it - probably just stick to my big mug of sweet tea.  If you can't leave coffee alone and you have heart burn, however, go ahead and try it.  Recommended for taste and low acid, not for cost."	0	0
		AZSVQQ6XTN4Y2	These are yummy!	I order Pop Chips through Amazon as none of my local stores carry the brand. I've tried a variety of the flavors they offer & all are very tasty, however, the sea salt & vinegar are by far my favorite. All I can say is....YUMMY.	0	0
		A2ZCYFSDHBZ2OE	Good the first time but stale the second time	We bought a package of these gummy bears in the store once and they were excellent but expensive. When we saw them on Amazon we bought the 12 pack right away because good organic candy is hard to come by. The first box was excellent, just like they were in the store - chewy with a very good gummy candy texture. We bought a second box 2 months later and they were delivered the other day, and every package looked the same - dry/crusty on the outside of the gummy bears. We opened and tried one package and they were soft and mushy with a sugary crust on the outside and the color was pale. They were shipped in the Texas heat part of the way and this seems to be a common theme on these reviews with gummy bears turning up crusty and bad, so beware!	0	0
		A2VJE7S4RMHDQG	excellent breakfast granola and snack	I purchased this pumpkin/flax granola from amazon and could not be happier.  I actually take it dry everywhere i go.<br />It makes an excellent snack,  i am anxious to try all the granola's now.  The omega's are high,  what better way to get them and it doesn't take much to satisfy a sweet tooth either.  The granola has just enough sweetness to satisfy any cravings, and is healthy too,  a win win.	2	0

		A1ODKP5Y7DPMM1	THIS IS THE STUFF :)	I have been doing a feral cat program for awhile now. The food is important but they love good cat nip and I HAVE FOUND IT !!!!!This is like medical marijuana to my wild cats. In the worst of times they sniff and eat this and get through the cold and fight to keep their territory...I love my TNR program I donated to Denver for wonderful reasons.

		ANHJK3DQKN8OR	Major Disappointment	"I've been a ""connoisseur"" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.<br /><br />The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture.  It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.<br /><br />The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.<br /><br />On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.<br /><br />I would not order these again."	7	0

		A1YIU2BAGMFNR6	If you love slim jims you'll love these	Ever since the unfortunate accident at Conagra factory, the prices of slim jims have jumped to ludicrous prices. 49.99 for a 100 pack of slim jims! No sir, you have forced me to look elsewhere. I came across these little morsels when I was having my yearly slim jim itch and boy did they fill the spot. I think it would best describe these as slim jims without the massive amounts of grease and with a more satisfying spicy flavor. If you're still having trouble finding slim jims these are the perfect substitutes or even replacements.	7	0
		A17TPOSAG43GSM	Doesn't meet expectations	Sounded like a great product - pepperoni with an extra kick of flavor. But when I first bit into it, it tasted bland and strange - I was expecting something like the Slim Jim Pepperoni sticks, which are soft and flavorful. Another thing I dislike, is that neither the box nor the product itself contains any nutrition information - you have to mail them to get the info, it says. 29 sticks to go..	0	0
		A26AL8KHZBQB7I	Nancy and the Pack	My dogs love these and it is very, very easy to get them to take pills using these.  They now look forward to getting pills and don't spit them out.  Just don't let them learn to chew them or they may figure out the pill is inside (i.e. keep feeding them little tidbits after the Pill Pocket).	1	0
		AO7BIHHOTA050	ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL	I am veeery picky about tea, it's my favorite indulgence. I have typically bought my tea from Teavana, but it's tough to afford it and sometimes I'm too lazy to make loose leaf tea. I've tried out tens of different bagged Earl Gray teas and this is BY FAR the winner. Tastes GREAT.	4	0

		A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW	Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more	"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."	11	4
		AG2AWQJXJ0UXJ	Great product for our cats.	We've been buying Friskies Party Mix for over 10 years and since moving to the Dominican Republic, we still order from the states and have them delivered to us here. Our cats are crazy about them!!!!	1	0
		A1O3ONM1MJM7EM	OK for an alternative snack	"Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating..""They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!""  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me."	2	1
		A12UCJF0YEOQL1	Never buying here again	This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on the internet, and I'm a frequent consumer of online purchases.  Firstly, this product was not shipped 3 weeks after I ordered it.  After emailing the company inquiring into my order, I was informed that they would now ship my product - 3 weeks after the order date!  Upon arrival of the purchase, I noticed a misshapen box on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box, I discovered my Fruit Snacks box was misshapen and squished, because it was placed in a shipping box that was smaller than the fruit snacks box, totally ruining the shape and appearance of the Fruit Snacks box.  In addition, under the fruit snacks box was a crumpled packing slip, which included a coupon for 5% off my next purchase from this company.  It's too bad the coupon expired 3 days before I even received the fruit snacks box, since the coupon was printed three weeks prior, when I actually ordered the thing.<br /><br />Tl;dr DO NOT purchase stuff from this company.  It is worth the extra time needed to find another supplier or buying it from the store.  I paid more for this product than it's price at costco citing convenience due to not having to leave my home, and ended up experiencing the worst online purchase in my 10 years of purchasing history.	4	1
		A2WWIUT5XJGFEY	tastes great	This tastes great on bar-b-qued food; it adds more bar-b-que taste. It is absolutely fabulous on grilled salmon. In winter, I use a cast iron skillet for the salmon and it adds a great outdoor taste to it.	1	0
		A7EK88GF8N40F	Incredibly satisfying	I am a serious chocolate aficionado. While these nuts are not coated in chocolate, they have a micro thin layer of dark chocolate that enhances their super crunchy goodness to the max. Interestingly, a small handful is very satisfying. I mention that because so many delicious foods have an addictive quality that makes you want to eat more of them. I would imagine it's the protein and fat content that allows them to be both a true food and a treat.<br /><br />Not only are they incredibly delicious, they come in a re-usable container that is great for dehydrated parsley, whole spices, or anything small.	1	0
		AJXR8WV959K48	tasted disgusting	This tasted disgusting and bland compared to the canned pumpkin that I usually purchase. The store-brand savings is not worth the sacrifice in flavor. I typically eat pumpkin straight out of the can because it is cheap, convenient and healthy.	0	0
		A3SUA8SKNMTM5M	Damaged in shipping	I have tried twice to order this product.  Both times Amazon packaging was perfect, but the manufactures seal on the bottle was bad.  The seal was still intact both times, but the liquid had still leaked out leaving quite a mess when I opened the package.  So I don't know much about trying the aminos themselves as I haven't got to use them.  Not ordering again, will try to find in store.	9	0
		A1N80TD4YD2JSP	Great Creamer, Terrible Packaging	"When I opened the box, there were approximately 23 containers, almost the whole top layer leaking, this caused the liquid to flow over the entire order.

Thankfully the other items were DVDs and easily cleaned."	1	0

		AMBLDL8NPVRRV	Life Saver	My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.

		AVLJU7X568PVP	Great treats, and a great deal from Amazon	These are wonderful packaged jerky treats, with nothing questionable in them as far as I can tell.  I would rather be making my own jerky, but since I don't have the time, tools and space to do so, these are great.  I get them delivered every 3 months, and end up paying only $0.67 an ounce, compared to the $1.59 an ounce I would be paying if I bought individual packages from Petco.

		A3CY0ZUSC93WE	Quality is inconsistent	I have edited my review three times. My first order-I was very surprised to find an improperly sealed package. Amazon responded promptly and replaced the coffee. The first batch had 2 sealed and one unsealed bag. The sealed bags tasted old from that shipment. The beans were dried out looking and the coffee bland. The replacement shipment was very good. I liked the coffee in the second shipment alot. It was full flavored and the beans were shiny and in good condition. I reordered this coffee and hoped it was an unusual event in their quality control.I subscribed to delivery service. Unfortunately the next batch was stale tasting, not vacuum packed and dry looking beans. Sadly I canceled the subscription. The quality is very inconsistent. At it's best it is great , and at it's worst - tastes very stale.	0	2
		A1BIZOUBLYA0MY	Homerun!	I ordered this as a surprise for my husband who loves bubble gum.  He was like a kid again when he opened the package.

		A1NVCHPBNJUTTC	Corn?? Really??	My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!	1	1
		A2QMFO9DX086UH	Yummy coffee, great price!	I've purchased this coffee twice through Amazon.  Both times, I received a great price.  Buying the 96-count was the cheapest route.  My husband loves this coffee!  We highly recommend it!	0	0
		A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	This product changed since I purchased it	"Update on 12/21/2011: My review below was based on what I purchased, which was altogether a different product than the one now listed.<br />..........................................................<br /><br />When I figured cost per ounce, the accountant in me had to order this product. Also, I was intrigued by the mix of coriander, lemon juice, basil and garlic. I know my olives and tested this next to a kalamata olive spread containing capers, garlic and oregano. I wanted so badly for this product to withstand the taste test.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say the deal is not good. I'm afraid you'll be immediately disappointed with this product. I'd not serve it to a Spaniard, Greek or North African (they know olives). The main ingredient in Gaea Green Olive Tapenade is an olive variety that is definitely not a table olive. There are many types and most make great table olives. You can see that under the Wikipedia entry for ""olive."" The olive used in this tapenade should be used for olive oil and fuel (the solid parts discarded from in oil production are often literally used as fuel).<br /><br />The major pizza chains do not use this type of olive on pizza. A stand-alone pizzeria in a Chicago neighborhood would be the subject of the local police blotter if it tried serving this type of olive on pizza. The addition of coriander, lemon juice and garlic did not compensate. By definition, a tapenade is supposed to use table olives. This is an instance where things that appear too good to be true are just that."	4	1
		A2M8JQ3AME7878	Vinegar... Not my taste!	This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.	0	1
		ACNON4BZACUUL	Be careful	I have never eaten flax before, and this last Saturday, I decided to add one teaspoon to my oatmeal.  After the first couple of bites, my throat started to feel weird, and felt like it was going to close.  With each bite, I started to feel worst and worst.  After eating less than half of the oatmeal, I poured it out.  I eat this oatmeal every day, plain, without flax.  No problem.  Next, I started feeling warm, my stomach was cramping, and I was puking.  I never get sick like this!!  I tried to call my doctor, but they were closed.  Thought I was going to die.	0	3

		A1TQIPT2QBAS6Z	"Agave ""nectar"" is a scam"	"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you."	13	5
		A12O1DKVHG4U8P	A Gum that Cleans your Teeth like Brushing them!	"I have never had a gum leave my mouth feeling so clean.  It's like ""you brushed your teeth"" feeling.  I hate the fact that almost all other gums now have aspertame that turns toxic when stored in a hot place (I don't know how it got to the store?!), so I would buy it even if it wasn't for the other best benefit of this gum - cavity prevention.  You have to take 3 or 4 pieces at a time to get the ""clinical-tested"" amount of xylitol to stop the bacteria that causes gum disease and tooth decay; but it's well worth the improved dental health... and the bacteria-killing effect is proven to work months and months even after you stop taking it.

		A2VHUE21J8A861	Excellent for finicky dogs	Just brought home a young APBT from the human society. He's lovely and wants to learn, but finding treats that grabbed his attention was difficult.<br /><br />Bottom line is he goes NUTS for these. I'm working with him to get over triggers he has while we're out for walks. Mostly going insane around other dogs and crying, yelping, and eventually full on barking with serious leash tugging. I'm invisible when he goes into this freakout state, however with a little work the treats grab his attention and bring the focus back to me. I expect within a few months to have him totally over this problem, and I'm relieved to find a treat that can help get him over this problem with lots of diligent training.<br /><br />Thanks Tillman you beautiful skateboarding pooch!!!	1	0

Healthy has a LOT of soy taste that is unpleasant and unexpected for me, a lifelong peanut butter eater.<br /><br />The Wowbutter flavor profile is just a lot more similar to ""real"" peanute butter and is great for sandwiches. I don't know how the I.M. Healthy and Wowbutter would fare relative to each other when cooking with them."	0	0
		A2A5OQT2N7S5AX	Flavorless	I remember eating this product many years ago when I was a kid. Sometimes you can't go home again. No flavor at all.<br />Even my dog wouldn't eat it. I gave it to my neighbor who has kids. They will eat anything.	1	1
		A3T4UQRGKU4SPG	Can't find the perfect Creme' Brl&eacute;e Coffee!	10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.<br /><br />This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.	0	0
		A2MUGFV2TDQ47K	Tang Energy FROZEN Beverage Drink Mix	"The item description is incorrect. The actual package says ""Tang Energy FROZEN Beverage Drink Mix"". Directions are for a GRANITA STYLE MACHINE that makes slushies TWO gallons at a time. All I wanted was a Tang Energy Drink Mix. I've been experimenting to discover the right portions for a water bottle, no luck. So I really can't speak to the Energy Boost, B Vitamins OR Caffeine, BUT I can speak to the weak lemonade flavor described by the other reviewer...he's right!<br /><br />I was expecting Tang with an energy kick. What I got was some pretty expensive flavored water you have STILL doctor up with inconsistent results ... 1 STAR and a SNAP!"	2	1
		A1WHBDP1R00L6V	Beware the Menadione!  2 Flavors OK.  Call them.	"I agree with ""Nicole Rae"":  it makes no sense whatsoever that Weruva would be using Menadione Sodium Bisulfite. You don't need a Vit K supplement, and if you want it then use kelp pwdr because it's cheap. Google this ingredient for yourself.  For some reason TWO WERUVA FLAVORS DON'T USE THIS INGREDIENT:  PAW LICKIN CHIKIN and PEKING DUCKEN. The kitten loves them, but he loved Poly BBQ and others too.  Hey, if it's banned for human consumption in some European countries, why take the chance. I called the company and simply gave them direct feedback:  please stop using this ingredient, then I'll buy the full line so long as the kittens will eat it and luv on it.  I hope they won't be 10 yr old cats by that time."	3	2
		A3O8ZE8BHREE0W	relaxing, almost like something you smoke	Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.	8	0
		A1JFSDFJXU5TB6	Taste is not good, texture is thin	I have tried a lot of different powders, and while I like that this one has fewer calories, the taste is just not that good. It's hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.<br /><br />There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders.	0	0

		A9NXTC0HTPSDO	Move Over Ban Roll On Deoderant:  lol  Here is Lickety Stik!	OK, so my dog loves this and she is a picky eater.  I literally had to force her mouth open and give a roll of it on her tongue and she has been hooked ever since.  I usually only give her high quality treats and chews but I figure a few licks of this roll on won't her her.  I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.  If it was better nutritionally I would have given it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great concept!  I just wish is contained better ingredients.  : )	0	0
		A3OBP99ZV5TG6C	Sea Salt and Pepper - a nice change of pace	"I buy Emerald nuts of all kinds on a regular basis.  I tried these and found that the normal cashew taste was present with a very strong presence of salt and prettty spicy pepper.  I did not detect that much of an aftertaste. Consistency was pretty much normal for cashews.  I highly recommend - as an occasional alternative to the ""normal"" brand.  The novelty factor for a product with this much ""zing"" is pretty high.  What tastes really good with the first handful... could pretty well go south after too long.<br /><br />I believe that this product makes for a pretty good desk ornament - your visitors will grab one handful, rave about what a trendsetter you are, then leave you without demolishing the whole container (which happens to me regularly with their honey roasted almonds).<br /><br />One thing that worries me is that so many folks leaving reviews have complained about the aftertaste and consistency. I guess I will have to buy a few more containers to check on the quality control!!!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"	1	1
		AWN422BQYHI3A	Totally Awesome snack - low fat/high protein.  Yum Yum	"I bought one (to try) based on the reviews for the 18-pack for $15.19.  They popped perfectly, tasted delicious (crunchy, not too hard, not too spicy, not too salty) and are a really healthy snack.<br /><br />ZERO GRAMS saturated fat.  Total protein per bag:  31.5 grams.  Total calories per bag:  210<br /><br />Within minutes of tasting them, I ordered an 18-pack.  These things fall into the ""Totally Awesome"" pile, for sure.<br /><br />If you like pork rinds and eating low-fat, high-protein snacks, this item might work out well for you."	3	0

		A150Y6RN6CVLN3	Passable, but muddy	"NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People ""Extra Bold"" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Jet Fuel:<br />Dark, almost burned coffee flavor (think bad Sumatran roast).  Heavy bitterness that overwhelms the flavor, harsh on the back of the tongue and a fully bitter aftertaste, but probably drinkable if you are a fan of Sumatran or French Roast coffees.  Medium acidity, a little tangy but not really sour, with an earthy flavor that tends toward muddy.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but generally overwhelms the palate.  Heavy body, but not sludgy, though your mouth may be convinced otherwise from the flavor.  While I can and sometimes do drink other coffees black (mostly full-bodied medium roasts), I can't imagine anyone drinking this black even if they take their espresso that way.  Requires sweetener and cream/half-and-half or a heavy addition of milk.  Personally, I had to use a small splash of vanilla syrup to hide the bitterness.  Drinkable, but just barely with better choices available. Hard to find the good qualities in the disappointing profile.  Certainly not the WORST dark roast I have had, however.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars for one reason.  If you were using this coffee as an ingredient where you wanted the coffee and perhaps the bitterness to not be hidden too much, then this would be an excellent choice over many harsh Sumatran and French Roast coffees."	1	1
		APKKMSUS73DI0	Great food for cats	My two cats love Science Diet. Only problem is I wish they would have a picture of the food on the outside of the bag. There is the dry which is tan, triangle shaped and the other is a dark brown,round shape. I always end up buying the wrong bag and the cats only love one.	3	7
		AZJHB1BU40E1Q	Caribou: an average cup of coffee.	The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...	0	0
		A2EOSIGYXIWNR9	bad batch from amazon	I feed this excellent cat foods from Petco to my two cats frequently and it agrees with them.

		A366ISPASB3NHK	Disappointed	I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?	0	0

		A21P1QGJAKNZ3G	Taste is individual	I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.	1	1
		A2NQ1MNUYUTRAP	Love it	I love this coffee, but what is with these prices? My local walmart sells it for $3.00 and some time on sale for $2.50 and here its like $4.15 each? why is that? and why would any one buy it from here?	1	0
		A164Q95DLO5REH	tastes horrible	I have been drinking dark magic for a long time, this in no way compares, its horrible, watery.

Very disappointing and no return policy. Don't buy it its junk.	0	0
		A39V8DFZBSET0B	This cereal is crap!	I don't eat cereal, but I bought these for my kids for a break from the healthy cereal I always buy them. I do however remember eating Chex as a kid and having it in Chex mixes. The cereal however is not the same as it used to be. The squares are so tiny now and they are flat instead of hollow like they used to be. Once milk hits them they get soggy instantly. I definitely won't buy this again. Guess the kids will have to stick with old fashioned and steel cut oats.	0	1

		A2DA9T5KNN66UY	Harsh	"This coffee is burnt tasting.  Like burnt toast.  The burnt taste overpowers the other flavors that may be there.  Not much coffee flavor detectable, reminds me of and old fashioned large percolator, after several hours, only more burnt tasting.  I have not had this problem with any other K-cups.  This one, Black Tiger, stands out as the worst tasting.  Adding milk added will not mask the overwhelming sour, bitter and chalky flavors.  I have tried it several times over the past 2 years, so I think I have sampled a few representative ""batches.""  My wife, who prefers the darkest roasted coffees, consistently complains about the taste, and drinks it only as a last resort.  She drinks a lot of coffee, and I see her point.<br /><br />Try any other brand, Donut Shop, Dark Magic, French Roast, any other brand is much more drinkable.  Maybe some folks appreciate the burnt taste.  If you like the taste of burnt toast, then you might like ""Black Tiger."""	0	0

		A3VDQDVHDE4PYO	Some Diamond Pet Food Wellness are RECALLED	"I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless.

		A1CHOKV10NEI8X	Very sugary	The flavor does do a good job of capturing the character of a cinnamon roll, but these are more sugary-sweet than regular frosted Mini-Wheats.

		AYW1TGDCP2OK6	3 Stars - I Guess??	I'm not really sure how to review a cat treat.  I assume my only course of action is to describe how my cat, Cleo, reacted to these new treats.  I should say first of all that Cleo is used to eating moist treats and hard food - she may have just associated this crunchy treat as a pebble of her food.<br /><br />Treat 1 - She ate it.  Cleo is a very tiny cat with tiny teeth (I usually have to find food that has very small pieces in order for her to eat it) and I noticed that she had a hard time chewing this crunchy treat.<br /><br />Treat 2 - Sniffed at it and licked it.  No eating.<br /><br />Treat 3 - Wouldn't go near it.  I picked it up and put it in her food bowl. And I noticed this morning that the treat was removed from her food bowl and kicked aside so that Cleo could eat her food.<br /><br />I gave this treat 3 stars because I like the idea of the green core that cleans the teeth - although, that green core is very hard. All in all, I'd say that my cat hated these.  But, she's a picky kitty.	0	1
		AX1Z5RQ1LWMM2	That is a lot of candy	My title was my reaction when I first opened the box it came in.  I didn't really plan on eating the whole bag since they are mostly gonna be used as reinforcement to get my kids potty trained.  My two year old girl doesn't really care so much but they work wonders for my four year old with autism.  I give her one after she potties and washes her hands and she couldn't be happier.  I do find myself reaching in and getting handfuls at times but I try not to go overboard.  If you love Skittles than this bag will probably be good for you but if you are just a casual candy eater than maybe not.	2	1

		A2R6RA8FRBS608	all right by me !!!	Gatorade was an acquired taste for me; but these days I can't stop drinking it. It's full of electrolytes and it does indeed have very few calories especially when you consider how it helps you rehydrate at the same time. You can drink this either cold from the refrigerator or warm from the shelf; I like it either way and actually when I drink it warm the flavor tastes even better.<br /><br />This pack comes in three flavors: fruit punch, lemon-lime and grape.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that this does have sugar (and carbs) in it; if you have concerns about sugar in your diet you should talk to your physician before drinking this.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	3	0

I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was ""mercury is less than 400 parts per billion"". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process."	5	14
		AS1GR7GQUZR8C	Breaks apart, dissolved in water! Poor quality	Bought this from one of the sellers here and was fulfilled by Amazon. When soaked, all of the tapioca pearls dissolved into water in mere 10 minutes! When cooked without soaking, they again dissolved and got mixed in with water! The package looks DIFFERENT from the one pictured here. It doesn't have any logos on it but states: Product of Thailand. No expiration date is printed anywhere.

The taste is nothing special, and is not as tasty as a box of Cracker Jacks. It is loaded with sugar and the price for for you get, it ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and stick with nutritional snacks. They are much less expensive, less calories, more nutritious, and better tasting. Just because a product is marketed as nutritious or low calorie, doesn't make it so. Read the fine print and be smart. This is a product you should pass on...If you get the craving for popcorn, make it yourself. You will save a bundle of money and it will be better tasting and more nutritious!

		A34IS8ZGXVNR9U	so hard you have to hammer it to break it up	These treats are so hard that I have to take a mallet out on a hard floor with a newspaper to break them up to give to my dog.  I would not buy them again.  My dog is a chewer, but these have no appeal to him unless I break them up first.  And he LOVES duck treats.	0	1
		A3JUM0WSKPN0NT	Stale	I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this...	1	3
		AUITG1DJ3QUGK	SULPHERED!	"I am posting this because unfortunately Amazon does not show the label, ingredients on many items.  Since you can not see it, many would assume that this is just dried fruit.  It is not.  It is fruit dried with sulpher.  For some this may not be an issue (but you should know that it is there nonetheless).  I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C"">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled ""unsulphured"".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off."	7	1

		AS6FJAE1LJV0C	Oily dilemma...	I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.	0	0
		AG0O3MED4Y55D	I Can't Believe the Price	I happened upon this item by accident when looking at coffee makers.

		AI1MNBBIZPBTJ	works for detox	I'm not sure what acai powder is supposed to do exactly- I'd heard all these claims about it being good for weight loss, having anti-aging properties, providing energy and boosting the immune system etc. I started taking it as just a general all around tonic because of the vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients. I have problems with my central nervous system so I'm really sensitive to toxins and chemicals both inside and outside my body. I hoped that this would be a better way of getting essential vitamins instead of taking artificial pills which irrate my nerves more. I can't vouch for all the other claims but it did work as a detox agent. After about two weeks of taking a full teaspoon everyday in my smoothie I started to get detox symptoms similar to when I took apple cider vinegar(also very healthful and nutritious) for a week. I started to get a really bad soar throat, bloatedness, a blocked, runny nose and headaches and irritability out of the blue. However, when this passed I DID feel better (more clarity, less anxiety, more able to feel my emotions etc). So it must be doing something right. To get around the problem of it not mixing well I put a teaspoon in a cup first and then added about an inch of a smoothie (not water or regular juice- disaster!)and mixed it into a thick paste first before adding more of the smoothie. I think this prevents it getting everywhere and not mixing well. So it was okay. If you would like a nutritious all round tonic and something with fibre and the daily quotient of vits and minerals I would also recommend Amazing Grass All Natural Drink Green Superfood.	0	0

		AMPPPNBMRAEBF	Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best	After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!	18	2
		A3CE0YNGQQDY57	Meh.	Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.	1	0
		A3M931MLZ5Y7IY	Exactly what I wanted	The Jimmies had purple in the mix.  That was exactly what I was looking for.  Since we are not planning on eating these (but throwing them instead of rice). I won't know taste.  But color is excellent!	0	0

		A1MU235UTCDM31	Hard to find excellent decaf beans on Amazon.	"TLDR version:  Look elsewhere if you want great decaf beans.  These weren't even worth the price at 57% off list.<br /><br />Normal version:<br /><br />I purchased these when there was a deal a few weeks ago, and have been brewing both espresso and drip coffee with them and a caffeinated variety by the same company.  This review is for the Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Decaf Espresso.<br /><br />The first thing to say about Larry's Beans is that they are all packaged quite well in individual boxes which contain the air-tight bag of beans.  This makes them easy to stack in a warehouse, and also prevents warehouse employees from inadvertently slicing open the bag when unloading a crate or larger package.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I immediately fished out some freezer bags and prepared to portion out the beans.  I opened the sealed bag and the beans smelled OK; the smell wasn't overpowering but it was not what I would consider ""gourmet.""  It's not old or musty smelling like some of the other ""gourmet"" decaf bean roasters represented here on Amazon, but it's also not top shelf.<br /><br />Although the beans are evenly roasted, I would definitely not call it Espresso roast.  The roast is more reminiscent of a mild breakfast roast - medium brown, not the dark black I expect when I think of espresso.  Also, the beans are very small - clearly not a premium batch of beans.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to accurately represent the style of roast, and for the beans to be large, although uniform in size.  Neither were the case with these beans.<br /><br />When portioning the beans into 1lb freezer bags, I found that the beans really aren't oily at all.  I surmise that this has to be due to the water process used to decaffeinate the beans, although I don't know this to be a fact.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to be oily enough to leave a clear film on the inside of the freezer bags I package them in, and this didn't accomplish that feat.<br /><br />As you can see, the initial impressions of the look and smell of the beans were only mediocre, not outstanding like the price should suggest.  Now, on to the flavor.<br /><br />Fresh out of the 5lb bag, I hand-ground enough of the beans for a couple of shots of espresso.  Yes, I have a counter-mounted hand grinder that can also be used to make flour from grains!  Anyway, I ran the ground coffee through my pump espresso maker, and what came out the other side had no crema, although the shots themselves didn't taste horrible.  The flavor was reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, with astringent, grapeskin-like qualities that struck me as quite bitter for the mild roast.<br /><br />I have since made pots of drip decaf with this bean, and combined it with a caffeinated version from Larry's Beans, and it's passable (carried by the excellent quality of the caffeinated beans, I'm sure), although still not what I would consider worth the price.  I haven't found any excellent decaf beans on Amazon, yet, so I will move on to another variety once this batch is gone."	1	0

		AB0Y33G717HOU	Large and awkward size for cats, might be better for dogs	"Another reviewer said these looked like ""hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes"", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say ""Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight.""  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />""Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food.""<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />""Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience.""<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet."	0	1

		A3GUUW20SO92AW	A Great Little Wine Kit	"I've been making wine at home for a couple of years now and have over a dozen kits under my belt.  I buy all of my kits at a local brew/wine store and am also somewhat active on an on-line winemaking forum so I'm pretty familiar with the various wine kits available out there.<br /><br />When I ran across these Vino Italiano kits on Amazon I was a bit leery as I had never heard of them before.  They were having a great special at the time, though, so I couldn't afford not to give them a try.<br /><br />I am very pleasantly surprised! It's a small volume kit at 5.1 liters of concentrate, but still makes the typical 6 gallons of wine. The packaging is first class and while the wine is still young (clearing in my carboy) I have every indication it's going to make a nice, red table wine.  If you've come across these and have been hesitant to order, there's no need.  They are quality, small-volume kits AND the even come with labels, corks, and foil tops.  I will buy again in the near future.<br /><br />04-28-2010 Addendum: This wine has been in the bottle for a little over 6 months now and I thought I'd update my initial report.  In a nutshell - this is a very pleasant, medium-bodied, red table wine.  It finished very dry, not fruit forward at all, but at the same time it goes down very easily.  I'd almost refer to it as ""gulpable"".<br /><br />If you're looking for a big, full-bodied Cabernet or Bordeaux style of wine, this kit isn't for you (probably not any of the Vino Italiano kits for that matter).  But if you're looking for a lighter, nice drinking red, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'd view this wine as food-friendly and it'll make a great pizza or picnic wine.<br /><br />I plan on making two more of these Vino Italiano kits and giving them a nice long rest in an oak barrel to see how good these kits can be given a little more patience and time."	12	0

		A2YDU3RZB63VXW	Holy SALT, Batman!	"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."	45	7

		A1XZAKSG7VLAOM	GM Double Black Diamond - Pretty good.	One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.  Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond meets most of that criteria pretty well.  It is a little more on the bitter side than I normally prefer, which I why I only gave 4 stars, but overall a great bold cup of coffee.  I would order this variety again.	3	1

I really emjoyed this flavorful treat. The softness immediately made me want to put it in the microwave to get a touch of that ""fresh out of the oven"" feel. Mission totally accomplished. Perfect snack for anytime and definately anywhere."	0	0
		A1OOXWXA2L2R4U	Wrong Product wrong Name	Gold Prince has made a terrible mistake.  There are two products.  COLDAID and FLUAID.  THey are different formulary.  Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, don't buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title	0	3
		A2DGJ1UBWCJ9RG	Great Taste - Poor Packaging	I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them. Two of the four contained absolutely no protective packaging to prevent them from moving around or being crushed. One box was crushed severely on one end and as a result two of the boxes containing the breadsticks was also crushed. Some of these boxes contain little more than bread crumbs. I have opened several boxes and have yet to come across even one whole breadstick let alone a box with the entire amount whole.<br /><br />I wanted to use these for gifts at Christmas presented with a decorated container to set them in and homemade spaghetti sauce and salad dressing. I would not purchase these unless you want to use them for breading.	1	0
		A30L62OR071JJ8	"Ingredients not detailed in description. ""Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener."""	"The first thing I did was check the ingredients because of all the different sweeteners  that claim to be Stevia but have fillers of some sort. I had chosen this brand because it's all natural, no chemicals, but unlike other pure Stevia sweeteners that I've tried, that have Stevia as the Main ingredient and Xylitol(to help with the caking) i.e ""Ingredients: Stevia, Xylitol"" this one reads, ""Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener.""  I was disappointed and thought you might want to know if you're looking for a real all Stevia sweetener. Amazon does not give refunds on grocery items, though they were gracious on this occassion to give one. I don't know about the taste, my main concern was that it was actually Stevia and then I can look into taste afterwards. One more thing, the description on the bottle label attributes digestive health to the inulin fiber not the stevia."	7	5
		A2C9XE9I8RSKNX	NOT  %100 organic.... Per the box, they are %70 organic.	The crackers are OK.  I am looking (note present tense) for a graham cracker that is organic, and these taste fair but the big ding comes from them not being %100 organic; the description did say %74, to be fair.  For $1.50, I can get the  14 ounce store brand box of graham crackers that use graham flour, and save some money if I'm not getting a truly organic product. YES, most of the ingredients are organic.... but one turd in a pool sends everyone running for the deck.  BUT, they are GMO-free- and that does help somewhat.<br /><br />The flavor.  Hmmm.  Well, they're OK.  I'll use up what I got. Maybe.  There is a mild cinnamon flavor that isn't awful, but not what I wanted. I like cinnamon, but I wanted more of a honey graham flavor. The texture isn't really 'crisp' either.  They're not soggy, but it wouldn't take much to make them soggy if they were used in something like a pudding dessert.  I won't reorder them.  For a natural product, there's a funny flavor and aftertaste.  Glad I got the Xylitol gum in this order to kill the aftertaste.	0	0
		A14D7LPS6L4TRN	good strong coffee	I keep buying Emeril's Big Easy Bold K cups because I am limited to about one cup of REAL coffee each morning, and this is REAL, STRONG and DELICIOUS. If you like your coffee strong and use K-cups, this is the one for you.	3	0
		A3JZNCC3VX1AAC	Lavazza Espresso Pods Gran Crema, 150-Count, .25-Ounce Pods	Probably the best ese pods in the market. they taste better the the much more expensive Illy pods.

		A2R5XZN1TDPLNA	uses for vanilla extract	Bought this item not for digesting but as a mosquito repellent that I heard from a show. They said using real pure vanilla extract would work. Well, it didn't. But I'm sure this vanilla is better for eating.	1	0

		A1S626PTC8FODC	Forget the 'Names' you know	Forget Clif, Luna, Builder's, Power Bar, Nature Valley or any other goop/grain brick you see in the stores. They can't carry the wrapper for a Pemmi Bar. Tasty, energy-packed, nutritionally balanced and all natural, these gems rock. I discovered the Raisin Nut variety 30 years ago, and they've been saving me ever since. They banish hunger, taste great and don't punish you with a sugar crash (I'm sensitive to this).<br /><br />NOTE: Eat these babies slowly. If you don't take small bites, you'll think you just bit into a chewy cotton ball. Pemmi Bars need saliva. So if you give them the space and time to generate it, you'll be a happy camper, biker, worker, traveler, spectator, parent or any other human who needs quick, big-time sustenance.<br /><br />BONUS: Pemmi Bars keep amazingly--probably indefinitely in the freezer, where I store mine. But I've eaten unrefrigerated bars literally years old. Taste and consistency suffer, but they still get the job done.<br /><br />At 420 calories a bar, Pemmi Bars outpunch all the rest and can easily replace a meal in a pinch. Don't want the whole thing? Rewrap it, and save it for a week. Or two. Or...yeah, I've eaten open ones pretty far down the road--with no problem. I'm obviously a major booster, and I put Pemmi Bars in the elite class of brilliantly effective, bombproof products including bow saws and the Concept 2 rowing machine. So do yourself a big favor. Try a bar.	1	0
		A1FW7FFNKLEMOG	Tastes Okay	For the price per bar I expected something a little bigger than the size of a Quaker Oats Chewy Bar.  It tastes okay and is sweeter than other bars I've purchased.  Can't say I'll buy it again.	0	0

		AVU1ILDDYW301	If you have squirrels. . . You'll love this suet	"There are three great things about this particular suet:<br /><br />1. Birds LOVE it!<br />2. Squirrels HATE it!<br />3. Doesn't melt!<br /><br />I live in Atlanta, and it can get very hot. . . .This suet is great! I see a variety of birds eating it such as catbirds, woodpeckers, finches, Carolina chickadees and more. Thrashers (and other birds) pick-up the fallen pieces from the ground too.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This item really is ~H~O~T~. Make sure to wash your hands after you touch it. . . or even better. . . use gloves.<br /><br />FYI, I recently purchased a ""Squirrel Buster Peanut Plus"" feeder, which holds what I call the ""suet peanut balls"" from C&S and it works really well. Though they make hot pepper peanut balls, that's really not necessary with the ""Squirrel Buster"". I have one of the large ""Squirrel Buster"" seed feeders, which is really great. ""Squirrel Buster"" feeders are not cheap, but they really work and you'll enjoy them.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007LQ3RQ"">Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plus Wild Bird Feeder with Cardinal Perch Ring</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061O2O8K"">Squirrel Buster Peanut Plus Wild Bird Feeder</a>"	2	0
		A1CIU572HUUE5A	Very good, but a little bland	I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick.	1	0
		A37GRDXEP6ZYQT	Could be better	This lemonade definitely tastes more like chemicals than real lemonade (a product like Simply Lemonade from the grocery store) does.  One reason might be that despite the organic name, there are unnecessary chemicals added simply to make it cloudy.  My other criticism of this product is that the size of it is awkward -- each pouch makes 1/2 gallon plus one glass, so you either always have a little bit left over, or you have to make it in a gallon pitcher that is almost half empty.	0	1
		A332WBOW8XMUVH	NOT the same as Samoas	Girl Scout Samoa cookies are probably my favorite cookies ever, but I rarely have them because I almost never come across them anymore. I did recently try Dreyer's Samoa ice cream which was awesome, but even that has disappeared from the store freezers. I think that was a Limited Edition flavor. Anyway, when someone advised me Keebler has come out with a version, I had to try them.<br /><br />Maybe it's unfair to compare the two cookies, but hey, they look exacted the same. These cookies aren't horrible, but they have a bizarre crumbly almost grittiness about them that is off-putting. Maybe it's the way the coconut is roasted, I don't know, but it's unpleasant. And the fudge is waxy. The other thing I noticed was peanuts was listed in the ingredients. I am allergie to peanuts, and I had eaten two of these before I realized it. But that was yesterday, and I haven't had a reaction. I'm not going to blame Keebler for this. I should have read the box first. But beware. These are cheaper than Samoas, I'll give them that.	0	0

		A2UOKA7GDYVT3U	puzzled	My three young cats are only happy with Whiskas Indoor cat food, so I felt safe ordering the 6 pound bag on line.  Sadly they will not eat the food that was shipped. They cry and looked up at me with hungry eyes. So I have purchased a new bag locally and they are happy cats again. I have no clue why they will not eat it other than it 'MAY' be stale.  It did not sit on my doorstep, I accepted the package immediately on delivery  The only difference I can see is that the local bag is a 3 pound bag, and the 'best by date' is three months later.  I am considering mixing small amounts of the 6lb bag slowly with the 3 pound bag. If that doesn't work I will give it to the local cat shelter.<br /><br />Had they liked it, I would have continued ordering it on line because of the convenience of having it delivered to my door.  It was delivered a day earlier than promised and it was packaged very well. There was no cost savings.	0	0

		AH2AW9U7GDTH8	The best taco shells ever!	These are the best taco shells ever. I love them! Everyone that I know that has had them agrees. So much better than others you will find in the stores. I also love that there are no GMOs. That was my main reason for buying and I knew Garden of Eatin has good products, so I took a chance and ordered using the subscribe and save. So glad I did. I could even give up chips and just eat these with salsa. These always arrive intact with the usually couple here and there broken, which will happen even when you go pick up at a store.	0	0

		A32TYYYGF646UE	Very tasty	I bought this Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water for my husband. He loves it! He tryed all different kind of coconut drinks, but there were with some preservatives and other junks (there were not tasty at all). This one taste great and is healthy!	0	0

		AHEASGAXPX0J4	Nice tooth cleaner midday	I do not like to chew gum and can't chew it too long without getting tmj symptoms, new gums have flavors that last well beyond my tolerance.

		A1KQ4K8AXXTWNK	LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!	"I've been using this about a week now.  Works better than any other yeast I've used.  Surprisingly enough, even the flavor is better:  less intrusive, gentler, not quite as ""acid"" as some of the other fast yeasts I've bought.<br /><br />BUT THE KICKER WAS TODAY'S RYE BREAD.  I used what I thought was a live sourdough starter for a 3-lb. loaf of rye bread.  No go.  In desperation, I FOLDED some of this yeast into the already kneaded dough, kneaded some more to get the yeast hopefully evenly distributed.  I'm sitting here looking at the loaf that's JUST come out of the oven.  Beautifully risen, beautifully scented.  Haven't tasted it yet, but am sure as hell looking forward to it.<br /><br />This stuff is great...and at the PRICE?  It don't get much better'n that."	1	0
		A30VN4L591S3UX	Disappointed	I read the previous reviews and decided to take a chance, but I was one of the disappointed ones. A great variety of coffee, but only 4 teas and NO hot chocolate or cider. I don't like coffee or tea so I'm not happy with this selection. I understand the concept of how this vendor is creating an assortment so you don't have to buy a whole package of each flavor, but how hard would it be to just make sure there are at least some of everything promised in the assortment.	0	4
		A2TUU2UVDBTF9V	Artificial tasting	Very artificial tasting. It reminds me of the flavor of a cheap cream soda or possibly a vanilla flavored medicine. The texture was fairly mediocre too; it was not very smooth or creamy.<br /><br />I'll give them two of five stars for using actual cocoa butter in their white chocolate, but I'd steer clear of this and look elsewhere.	0	0
		A3U8BN5XGH6LNI	Review of shipment of Sixlets	I received my shipment of the Sixlets; however, I was upset that it was package so that 7 of the individual boxes had come open and there were a lot of of sixlets rolling around in the box. I had to dispose of them as I did not feel that they were safe to eat. This is the first time something like that has happened.	0	1
		A3C40PJ9YXREQ5	A nice treat for the critters	Our dogs seem to have very broad tastes in dog food.  They were just as happy to eat this as their regular food, or any other dog food we've given them.  Given that this is almost certainly a bit pricier than what they normally get, this would have to be a special treat kind of thing for us.  It didn't seem to do anything special for them in terms of energy, coat, etc., but they really weren't on it long enough for a valid comparison.  If I had more money than human being should be allowed to have, this would certainly be a regular part of their diet, just because they seemed to like it so much.	1	0
		A2KX4741KP6G8W	Ok if you need to figure out what you like	The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.<br /><br />It's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk.	0	0
		A1MS4RZMF3598R	Use Caution	The herb in this tea is VERY strong...so if you are sensitive this is not for you. If, however, you have trouble going to the bathroom regularly, this is amazing. I was too sensitive to take it...I was in the bathroom right away...so I gave it to a friend and it is the only thing that she has ever tried that has worked on her constipation. Not sure how good it is for dieting, but I bet if your body can tolerate it, it would work well.	0	0
		A3Q48TFCVGEKR2	Product recall issued in Taiwan	There is a Chinese article from Taiwan (found in yahoo-Hong Kong) that issued a product recall for all Indomie Noodles.  The test result from Taiwanese authorities shows that the product contained excess amount of preservatives. Although damage to human may not be immediate but prolonged consumption could lead to kidney disease.<br /><br />I, myself, used to love this product but I have reduced the consumption of all Instant Noodles from once a day to once every 3 to 4 months.  Best to stay away from these processed food especially one with a recall.<br /><br />([...])	9	8
		AS4V5TKK1VD4T	seem good to me	i am no expert on vanilla, but these beans seem very good to me! extremely fragrant. nice and moist and oily.<br /><br />*Update: the beans i didn't use immediately got extremely moldy and foul smelling within 4 months. changing from 4 to 3 stars. they were stored in sealed bag in cabinet. should come with instructions to use immediately or proper storage instructions or expected shelf life. these were purchased from Olive Nation aka JR Mushrooms. will try a different vendor next time.	3	2
		A2KRRM1ZSINL1W	A little slice of heaven!	Chocolate+Coconut+Hydration = HEAVEN!!  So I put this to the test after one of my triathlon training sessions yesterday.  Not only did it completely quench my thirst and hydrate me, but the taste was sensational.  Light enough to drink post-workout but also filling enough to feel refreshed.  It kept me from feeling that 3-4 hour post workout fade.  I was alert and ready to go the entire day!  What a difference from the high fructose hydration drinks that are out there.  A 10!  A true taste sensation!	0	0
		AVLF4DX8MEPL8	Not That Great	I was expecting a bit more flavor out of this coffee.....not as robust as I would like it to be.  The name of this coffee doesn't reflect the actual flavor......sorry.....1st negative review I have written in years.	2	0
		AT7AUGAJUM3OS	Sugar, corn syrup,  AND artificial sweetener?  No thanks!	I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office.  Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.	4	3
		A288XUYT5OXPBQ	Pretty good jerky.	This jerky was decent.  The softness of the pieces were in general pretty good, a little on the hard time sometimes but overall soft enough to chew comfortably.  They do vary a little bit within the bag so some pieces may be a bit too hard, but usually they don't get too soft.  The Sweet and Hot flavor tasted pretty good; so did the Teriyaki.  I'd recommend both!	1	0
		AF5WQ4JZ5KEMQ	Misrepresented amount	I love Rishi Tea.  Its flavor is fantastic and its all gluten-free.<br /><br />But, I based my order on the 3.3 oz size.  I received a 2.6 ounce and now see the picture represents that size.<br /><br />This is a HUGE mistake so I have to give 2 stars.  I hope this will be corrected so I can continue my subscription.	3	0
		A3MDZ81XJN0SR7	Not Enough Bacon Flavor.	"Been a Spam fan for over 40 yrs. & thought the Bacon Flavored version would be something different. Sorry to say that it just didn't have any, or very little, bacon flavor. Tasted like a can of regular Spam. Called Hormel Customer Service to voice my concerns and got a curt response of ""we can't satisfy every customer's tastes"", end of conversation. Thought they'd be a bit more receptive to a long time customer's comments but they weren't. If you like regular Spam you'll like this, just don't expect much of a Bacon flavor."	4	3
		A2XKEIF3TE0AS1	Surprised	I think if you need a gluten free diet this bar is for you.  But if you can eat wheat, I prefer Zone Bars (Mint) better.  I bought these after all of the good reviews but when I ate it-it didn't taste like white chocolate at all and the texture is a little gross (sorry).  It also is good for fighting hunger, but so are Zone Bars so I think I will stick with them.	2	0
		A34F9NN2U8QBY4	The name says it all!	I LOVE this tea!  My first introduction was a gift from one of my former students, and I am absolutely hooked on it.

		A2BBY5HVWEJEEX	Dogs really like them	My dogs love these. They start drooling everytime they get these. Not really sure if they do anything for their teeth/breath. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars just because these are alittle pricey considering they are gone in like 30 seconds.	4	0

		AKXP2X8EIWTIK	my two dogs are now genuises	I just opened a bag of these mini naturals in chicken flavor, and did some training with my two shelties.  Within a few samples of the treat, my dogs were doing whatever I asked, quickly, and for quite a long time.  I've never had their undivided attention for such a long training session.<br /><br />I will keep ordering these for training.  Clearly my dogs see these as a high value reward.  I will swap flavors to keep them interested.<br /><br />Good price for such a quality product as well.  Nothing made in China.	0	0
		A1BUDJ14QW5P2C	WARNING MADE IN CHINA!!!	"I am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in CHINA. Treats from China have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs. Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description, ""read the label carefully"". In very small print the country of origin is disclosed. I do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from China.<br /><br />These are great treat. My dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers. However, at most other on line pet websites they are half the price. Usually Amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products."	4	0

When Via came on the market, I was excited because I love Starbucks, but it's such a hassle to fit in the time to find an outlet/get there/ stand in line, etc when traveling.<br />And then came Via Columbia.  I have been transported to a heavenly world of flavor, instant availability even when traveling and a reasonable price besides!

		A1KWB6TJIPKGV3	Rip-off	I have ordered different knotted bones from Amazon before and been very satisfied. I ordered almost $80 worth of bones from this company and the quality is inferior.

		AAWU2W1J9SRHM	Doesn't taste the same	I've been making lots of dirty martinis lately,so I thought I would try out olive juice brine since I go through olive juice in the jar very quickly.  I wasn't impressed with the product,not only did it not taste very good,but it also used more than expected,so the bottle wouldn't have lasted long.  I also purchased the Dirty Sue martini mix,I haven't tried that one yet.  If you like the taste of a dirty martini you would drink if ordered at a nice bar/restaurant then this product would not be satisfying.	3	0
		A1S8FJT0AQSF60	Pretty good for microwavable food, but too pricey...	I really wasn't expecting much from this dish, but was pleasantly surprised. Most one-bowl microwave meals are edible but not much beyond that. This dish, however, was quite tasty and filling as well. Keeping the sauce and pasta separate really does the trick, since the pasta has no chance to get mushy. On the contrary, it was pretty firm and had a nice bite to it. I prefer whole wheat pasta, and the taste, while not as good as if I'd cooked it myself, was more than passable. The tomato/basil sauce was quite good, just spicy enough, with some distinctive and separate flavors. And designing the sauce tray so that it can be picked up and poured over the pasta was a nice touch. All in all, I found this much more palatable than other microwave dishes I've eaten. However, the current price of 6 for $36 ($6 apiece) is far too high for what you're getting, especially when similar dishes sell in supermarkets from $2 to $3 each. So is it good enough to buy? No. Lower the price and I'd consider it.	0	0

		A29BHW9YT2FZ77	Average offering from Wolfgang Puck	"So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought ""untested"".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatra's bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.<br /><br />So, this is utterly average in all departments.  It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WP's that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time I'll be more discerning."	3	0

		A2MUGFV2TDQ47K	Sweet Delight...It's Pretty Good!	"This was a Manager's Special for cheap (two bucks a box) that I gave a try. It has milled cane sugar as the second ingredient BUT that is soooo much better than High Fructose Corn Syrup for the human body. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth or two. My teenager will eat ONE bowl and be satisfied versus ""inhaling"" bowls and bowls of fruity loopy stuff. I enjoy it because there's 26 of the recommended daily 48 grams of whole grains per serving, it's all natural, no preservatives, a good source of protein, and a ""good"" sweet taste. Kids and grown-ups BOTH like this straight out of the box, as a hot or cold cereal with milk, mixed in yogurt, and sprinkled on ice cream!"	0	0

Not only is this particular flavor of rice - Wild and Whole Grain Brown rice just Naturally Good it is also Good Naturally. Those B' vitamins are very tasty.

		ALH0SRFGB3OBJ	Very good tea	I've tried other k-cup green teas and find that the Twinings was the least bitter.  Every morning before I go to work, I use a small Rubbermaid Mixermate container and fill it up at 11 oz with one flavored herb tea bag at the bottom.  Green tea generally doesn't have alot of flavor so I add something to it so I still get the benefits.	1	0
		A1MJI53T1G0OUT	GREAT GRAIN FREE OPTION	"After MUCH research and two complete urinary tract blockages we discovered that our cat SHOULD NOT be eating grain. Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market. Manufacturers like to insert grain into pet food to their reduce cost and create inexpensive calories. Grain causes alkaline urine in both cats and dogs. Alkaline urine leads to crystals and bladder stones and develops when an animal eats pet food with grains and fillers (high carb diet). Our pets need only meat, organs and water for proper nutrition and you are not ""spoiling"" your pet by feeding them an all wet food diet. Kidney failure is one of the most common diseases in cats and I have learned that I'm putting unnecessary strain my cat's kidneys by feeding him crap food. I purchased 8-10 grain free options for my cat to try out because it's very difficult to get an animal to change their diet once established. Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken was a clear winner with my cat Otis and I highly recommend it. If you think you can't afford a grain free diet for your kitty, please consider the $4,000 I have spent unblocking my cat's urinary tract when crystals formed (emergency procedure). Also, be wary of so-called prescription diets that the vets insist will remedy the problem, they are also full of grains and fillers."	60	1
		AODLYAXCJ0Q8L	These don't taste great.	I love Fig Newtons and so does my 7 year old, so I thought I'd try the minis in a convenient size. Unfortunately they don't taste very good. There is hardly any fig inside and they're a bit dry. I'll opt for the regular size Newtons the next time I buy them.	1	0
		A3BYCX1GWE73T6	TOO EXPENSIVE	My cats go nuts for this but it's way to expensive.  Also, I have purchased 10-20 bags at one time and alot of the bags contained mostly crushed, powdery ingredients in the bags.  I don't know why this is but I'm not going to spend all that money for powder instead of pieces of the treats.  It's a shame because it's an excellent product but who can afford it!	1	0
		A3OVAPZJAYB25Y	Cat Loves It	This is a very good cat food.  It has a good amount of water and whole meat and is very much enjoyed by my cat (and she is really picky!).

Acana is a higher protein dog food without all of the soy, corn, and meat ""byproducts"" most mass produced foods have. This food is more expensive than some foods out there, but it's worth it to keep our little lady healthy and happy. The lamb and apple flavor is her favorite ever, and it has nothing but great ingredients. There isn't anything on the label that is unidentifiable or questionable. Definitely worth the price!"	0	0

		A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW	Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more	"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."	11	4

		A7EJERNB7IK3Z	Weakest, worst 'French Vanilla' coffee i've ever tasted!	As a longtime avid fan of vanilla flavored coffee, I was excited about trying this brand of 'French Vanilla' on our new Keurig machine. In short, I am VERY dissapointed with this one! At any setting on the Keurig, this coffee tastes terrible. There is next to no vanilla flavor or notes (and the little there is tastes totally artificial and way off on accuracy for vanilla), and the coffee itself tastes very cheap and low quality. I wouldn't even give away these remaining French Vanilla K-cups, so I just tossed them in the garbage.	5	1
		AZ2NEHE8TNRUW	weak Earl Grey	This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.

		A93LBTV617ZVC	Fried? Eggplant~	As far as I can tell, this eggplant product is not fried at all.  I was very disappointed to open up an oily can of mushed-up eggplant.  After I diligently poured/swabbed off as much oil as possible, I then warmed up the contents to discover that the aroma and flavor is very appealing and tasty--just not the fried product that the can label depicts.  Also, the bottoms of the cans of the case that I received were forming rust spots in many areas. It makes me wonder where this case was stored.  Had I realized that the contents were this mushy, I never would have bought a case of it.  However, it will make nice addition to my home-style pasta sauces and other tomato-based stews.	0	2
		A1O4F81GWJE9HL	Looks & Tastes Great, but artificial flavor & color	"We tried these because my husband loves Horehounds (they are an old home remedy for sore throat but also tasty and something we ate in childhood). The Horehound are all natural, nothing artificial so I ordered the Sassafras ""assuming"" the same would be true. My bad for not paying closer attention.<br /><br />As long as artificial ingredients don't cause negative reactions for you, these are a great little snack. They are hard candy, dusted with sugar, orange in color, with a light, fresh, kind of, sort of root beer flavor. It's a little hard to describe. I love these little devils even though I am allergic. sigh.<br /><br />Anyway, very good, light, unusual flavor that I would recommend."	0	0
		A266ZC0U3JP84N	K cup coffee and tea	I think this is the greatest thing. I got a Keurig as a gift and found a whole new world for coffee and tea.

		A3RNVTDCBB0NFI	Handy Dog Treats	I orginally purchased these treats at a speciality dog boutique and found my dog loved them.

The balance of the spice and sweetness is spot on. It seemed rather fresh. This stuff is just plain good.

		A3M7BCQKSQAK4L	Best tea drink I have ever tasted....	I have had various different varieties of bottled tea drinks over the years and none have ever been the perfect blend... until now. Chantea's Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is the first time I have had the perfect bottled tea drink.<br /><br />Why do I think it's the perfect taste? The balance between the strength of the tea and the strength of the fruit flavors is right on the nail. Typically, what I have experienced from other bottlers is either the tea flavor is too strong or the additional flavors are weak or fake.<br /><br />If I could, I'd fill the garage with cases of it. If you want an authentic flavor in a refreshing size, this is the drink for you.	3	1

		A3D1TZH619NKHN	Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix	This is surprisingly good... IF you really like ginger.  I was expecting a sweet lemony/ginger drink, but could tell as soon as I added the water that this is very very ginger, with just a hint of lemon and a slight sweetness.  The ginger flavor is very strong and very sharp, like a strong ginger beer (or about 4 times stronger than ginger ale).<br /><br />The crystals dissolved quickly in hot water and the drink was still pretty strong at 1 & 1/4 cups of water (the packet said to add 250 ml -about 1 cup).  While I do not think that I'm likely to buy this by the 6 boxes of 12 drink mixes it is being sold by here,  I would definitely be interested in purchasing this drink in smaller amounts.  I could see this being helpful in the case of an upset stomach or sore throat, as well as as an occasional drink for anytime... If you really like ginger.	0	0
		A38TEL0C6YPSNA	Not Up to Expectations	I have been trying all the Lavazza whole bean products and frankly, I haven't been happy with any of them.

The only thing I like about the Lavazza beans is that they are not overly oily, like Starbucks or other mass market brands and so they are better for the long life of my automatic espresso machine.	0	0
		A2XAQOWHRPY98K	The Ultimate Test: Does it Taste Good?	Okay, taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary when it comes to these cookies. With that disclaimer, I will say that I was looking forward to consuming these cookies because I do not just have a sweet tooth, all of my teeth are sweet--and baked goods are my number one temptation. I had one of these cookies and did not want another, even when I was jonesing for sweets and dying of hunger. I wouldn't even eat a second one of these when there was nothing else available. That's a bad sign. I ended up putting out my box in the break room at work, where they were snatched up (note: if you put out a half-eaten sandwich in that breakroom, someone is sure to eat it, if you get my drift). The cookies were bland, dry and nothing at all like good homemade cookies. If you're going to indulge, don't waste calories on something like this!	0	0

Usually I'll get the store brand of fat free light TID, but this was recently on sale so I decided to go ahead & try it.<br /><br />It's not bad, having a great texture & not needing a lot of it to coat the salad.

		A1SAAS0MGWZ8FN	Not the best decaffeination process	I called the company because my concern is how they decaffeinate their product and I was disappointed that they used some solvent (ethanol in the process) rather than the safer CO2 process.  So I ordered ECGC from NOW and its fairly decaffeinated only 4 mg of caffeine and they use the CO2 method.  Do your research.  I think if you are going to take something for your health then it should not have residues which may be undesirable.	44	18
		A1DIO4AGQVCCJY	No longer my dogs favorite food, causes vomiting.	This is was the only dry food that we have feed to our dogs for years but recently it seems as if they changed the recipe because both of my dogs are not able to digest the food as easily and now vomit periodically when this food is eaten.  I like the idea of feeding my dogs organic food and I am willing to pay more for it but certainly, if they are vomiting, there is something in it that is not healthy.  When I switched to another brand, sold by the vet, they no longer vomit but the vet does not sell organic.  I'm still not sure what the best alternative is.	0	0
		A1Z07EWGKEN9V6	Emeril's Coffees have burnt flavor	Emeril's coffees have a burnt flavor.  It is good strong coffee and would have been very good but the burnt flavor ruins any enjoyment.

		A274M0XV1H9OG1	Diarrhea	My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?	4	0

		ALZL9MH8WVQMW	Loose stools from beginning to end	I am very fond of Wellness brand itself, but this particular kind just did not get along with my dog's digestive system. I purchased at Petco store.

		A3740461VZQ9SH	Got Progressively Worse...	"I love Think Thin Bars.  Love them.  I eat one every morning. This crunchy peanut butter is my favorite.  ""Subscribe and save"" seems like a bargain, but by the time I was six months into the program, the bars I was receiving were bloomed, chalky, and gave every appearance of having been stored in a hot place, which certainly compromised the quality and eating experience (and maybe even the nutritional value, like the vitamins).  I cancelled my subscription, and am back to buying them at a higher price at my local grocery store."	0	0
		ARXU3FESTWMJJ	Maybe not the healthiest snack....but sure tastes great!	I am definitely a chocolate lover, and fond of granola as a cereal so thought I'd try a bag of this, even though it isn't necessarily meant as a cereal. I think it would be a bit hard to eat as a snack, as the granola is fairly crumbly and not in large chunks. The chocolate as well is separate from the granola so hard to just eat from the bag. As a cereal, it tastes amazing! I probably would have liked a little *less* chocolate just so I didn't feel so much like I was eating candy, but I can't fault the taste at all, it really had a great blend of granola crunch, a bit of sweetness, and that semi-sweet chocolate taste that blended perfectly. Definitely not something I would eat everyday, but for a mid-day snack with milk, I really loved it.	1	1

		A2DON3TNZ0QPL4	Best gluten-free pasta on the market	"I have several family members with celiac's so cooking for a large italian family gathering is a huge challenge if you want to keep your meals simple when pasta is a must have menu item.  I've tried all the brown rice based pasta brands with mixed results.  They are either cook up too gummy, release a lot of starch in the water while cooking, fall apart when mixing the cooked pasta with other ingredients or they do not make great left-overs the next day.  The Le Veneziane pasta is fantastic!  My very picky daughter didn't even realize she was eating gluten-free pasta (she always turned her nose up for the brown rice pasta).  This corn based pasta cooks, feels and taste like the ""real"" deal and my entire family now prefer this brand over all other wheat based or gluten-free pasta."	1	0
		A22Z9R91N8L7IQ	I'd Like To Actually Review This; But Amazon Won't Let Me	"I've giving it three stars based on a guess and on the taste of the non-chocolate flavor. I sort of like the regular, non-chocolate malt, so I'll put the chocolate variety in the middle.  Though I might have given it five stars, had Amazon sent it to me.<br /><br />How about an explanation?<br /><br />OK, I ordered Ovaltine Chocolate Malt Drink Mix, like it says here.  I received malt, no chocolate.  Told Amazon.  They were very nice and immediately shipped another order... of plain malt again.  Since, I've tried to get a response from them.  No real answer, my emails are ignored (very unlike Amazon).<br /><br />I mean, if  they're having some sort of problem finding the right Ovaltine, at least respond and don't leave a very good customer hanging.  Just makes sense to me.  I appreciate courtesy, don't you?<br /><br />Now, at first, I was willing to forgive and forget; but stonewalling ain't nice.  Nope, not a proper way to treat customers.  I really must again add that this is not like Amazon; but somebody has really dropped this ball.  I even have gone to the trouble of paining them pictures,twice, giving links to the different Ovaltines.  No appreciation for my efforts; just silence.<br /><br />I mean, is it possible they expect me to accept what I didn't order but paid for?  Do they think sending another wrong item makes it OK?  Well, you see,their ""expecting"" that is what I don't like.  Changed my own generosity.  Come on, who likes to be stonewalled?  It's arrogant.<br /><br />So, if Amazon will just send the chocolate Ovaltine, as shown here, I'll re-edit this and tell you what I really think of the chocolate version.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />Well, I still haven't tasted the chocolate; but I thank Amazon for refunding my money.  They say they found something wrong with the product.  Maybe it just wasn't there?"	2	3
		A2696CFF1SBXH0	Delicious	It is as close as cooking it from scratch. Everyone at work has asked me about. Once I add very hot water to it, it makes the room smell as if it was being cooked on the stove top. It almost smells like out of the oven apple pie. I would suggest that you fill it up with very hot  water all the way to the top. Being careful of course not to burn yourself. I usually place it first on a saucer, so I can carry it that way. If you fill it to the line, it is very thick. By filling it all the way to the top, it makes it taste like it was freshly made and just thick enough but not thick as glue, like it would be if you only fill it to the line. Also, I like to leave it covered with the lid that comes with it for about 5-7 minutes and then enjoy it. I would definitely buy again. I do recommend it.	1	0

		A2PSB4WQHH46HN	Where's the tortellini?	It is mostly broth, with the advertised 3/4 cup of vegetables. However, each cup contains about 3 tortellinis.

It tastes good and I like all the veggies (plus it has low sodium) but I really wish they would include a couple more tortellini.	0	2
		A2K4QHGOVF7VZ0	First ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil )	"The ingredient tab on the product page doesn't show what is in this cappuccino.

I wouldn't have purchased this had the product info been shown.  I didn't know they still used this stuff.  New York outlawed the stuff and the FDA explicitly makes manufactures show this ingredient.  Shame on Amazon for not displaying this.  I did order addition K-cup coffee. I""ll return them."	11	4
		A14SOW889A4TAT	Over-fried	I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.	1	3

		A3JLOIXFM75QNV	Too pricey for cat food	At almost a dollar for one TINY can (the same exact size as a fancy feast) I would personally never buy this product; it just isn't worth it. I was glad that I ended up picking this from the Vine program because my cat did like the Chinese Chicken one. She devoured that in an instant and licked the bowl clean. She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them. It would be nicer if they had different varieties in the case, not just 2. However, I think for the most part, cats would generally like this cat food.	0	0
		APJFQN4KTXUHR	Was: Whole Cookies! Now: Still arrive as mostly crumbs	Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.<br /><br />Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.<br /><br />Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.<br /><br />Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.<br /><br />Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookies<br /><br />Original review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.<br /><br />The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.	0	0

		A3BJ9H8BT03QIC	Excellent Dog Food	I own a very active, healthy border collie/bulldog mix that is 2 years old.

But tastewise I'd also compare it to ""Honeycomb"", because once when I had a real craving for ""Honeycomb"" I stumbled on this, noticed the generous amount of fiber, and decided to give it a try.  YUMMMMMM!!  I'm so glad I found it!  It's healthy and has lots of fiber & stuff like that - and at the same time, reminds me of those kids' cereals I used to love!  ENJOY!!"	0	0

		A1QK91G8NM5XI1	Would be great, but packets not sealed.	"While quite expensive compared to sugar, I think this is the best artificial sweetener product out there. The sucralose used in this product is superior in taste to any other artificial sweetener, and does not appear to have any health issues. Sucralose is also very heat-resistant and therefore suitable for baking, though that is not such a factor in the small packet packaging in question here. Since the pure sucralose compound is like 600 times sweeter than sucrose sugar, the actual quantity needed to sweeten a cup of coffee is almost microscopic; therefore it makes a great deal of sense for Splenda to add soluble fiber to bring up the bulk to a more normal and convenient-to-handle level. And of course the fiber is good for you. This product, though sorta powdery, sinks below the surface instantly and dissolves quickly even in cold water if you stir it a bit. It's great stuff.<br /><br />Now,the big problem I have found with this product is in the packaging. About a third of the packets in the box I have are not perfectly sealed along one edge. All in the same location on the same edge. I ""suppose"" the product (being non-nutritive) would not become infested with bacteria or bugs... I ""suppose"" nobody put poison into the packets... but out of principle I ended up throwing all those unsealed packets away. This is probably a freak short-term problem, but Splenda better get their packaging act together if they don't want to ruin the reputation of an otherwise fine product."	1	1

		A2KXRMLVN693R6	New out of box and blender does not work.  Solved with a DIY fix.	As many other one star reviewers have posted my unit's blender function did not work.  It is a brand new unit right out of the box.  Steam function works great, but the motor would never turn the blender blade so my food just sat there.  Luckily there's an easy fix.  I took the entire unit apart and found that the belt from the motor was not engaging the turnshaft that would in turn enable the blade to spin.  After properly aligning the belt I put it all back together and the unit now blends like it is supposed to.  My guess is that this is the same problem that caused others' blender function to not work.  I would futher venture that the Brezza knows about this issue and has done nothing to correct it.  It's hard to believe that after multiple complaints about the same problem that Brezza does not put its units through some sort of inspection process to prevent this from happening.  It is very frustrating to have to fix a brand new product that has just been taken out of the box.	70	4

		A55OCDYYJZBSB	eat a fig bar instead	"This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that ""yogurt powder"" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the ""natural flavorings,"" etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a ""vitamin blend"" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again."	2	2

		A13NSUJ2BDIFAC	More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.	Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.	2	0
		AGLBXNX8O9JSX	Tastes nasty	I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.	4	4

		A2V7A7W8FFVD8F	Looks good, not great	"This is my first bonsai.  I will try to update this review periodically with more information.<br /><br />The plant arrived in good condition and well watered.  Mine does not look  like the picture.  It is definitely a lot more sparse and less ""natural"" looking.  I'm hoping that some pruning will fix that over time.  It also lost a few leaves on the first day, but seems to have really come alive after being watered and given sunlight.  I'm sure 3 days in a box can't be too healthy for it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, there are two holes at the bottom of the pot, so you'll need to figure out a way to deal with the water which leaks out.<br /><br />Update 9/23/2008:  I would bump this review up to 4 stars, but Amazon won't let me.  The plant still hasn't filled out much more and still does not look as good as the picture, but it has remained remarkably healthy with very little effort.  I've kept it at my desk at work where it receives little if any sunlight.  Watering it twice a week and occasionally moving it near a window for a weekend has kept it very healthy and green.  I've received lots of positive comments from co-workers."	3	0
		A2ZHSXTQO831OS	Great aroma, bad headache	Here's the conversation that took place at my house:<br /><br />You're not brewing some of that fru-fru coffee, are you?<br /><br />Yes, I am.<br /><br />A whole pot?<br /><br />Yup.<br /><br />I hope you're not using the regular coffee pot.<br /><br />Of course not. (this was a lie.)<br /><br />I'll be able to tell if you do...<br /><br />Sure.<br /><br />He's right.  I'm wrong.  The kitchen smells great.  The filter smells great.  The coffee pot smells great.<br /><br />Pity the coffee didn't taste even as good as my normal cheap store brand, and it gave me a headache.	0	0
		A1PIESEVP0F6IE	Great Variety, Convenient and Kosher too!	Tasty, very convenient, especially if you don't live near an Indian restaurant (closest one to me is just over an hour's drive away) These packets are way easier and cheaper than takeout. Easy to microwave, but cover it very well, it likes to splatter. I do a paper towel *and* a paper plate on top of the bowl. Trust me, it's messy if you don't. You'll probably want some rice or naan to go with it, as there is a lot of sauce. Also, if you're concerned about portions, you'll want to know that the packet is more than one official serving, but it is so good that I usually have it all for one meal. The spinach paneer is just a bit less flavorful and spicy than the other dishes, but if you're in the mood for something a little more toned down, it's perfect. It was fun to go through the different kinds and flavors to see which ones I like the best. They're Kosher too, and some of them even look ok for Pesach, based on the ingredients list (and your own practices) Sounds like a lot of details, and a bit more prep than some nuke and go meals but it so worth it. Yum.	1	0
		A21N3NX6IIMZ1X	Didn't like at all!	I was really excited to try this, thinking it was actually going to taste like a dark chocolate hot drink. I was sorely disappointed. In my opinion it was WAY too sweet and I didn't even get a hint of dark chocolate taste. To make matters worse, if you read the ingredients on the box, it's full of chemicals I can't even pronounce, as well as artificial sweetener. Save your money and keep looking.	0	0
		A21CL12FJDWDO6	Magic in a bottle!	Ok, so not sure why the person is griping that there are fake reviews but I have to say this is true to claim. My dog passed away on May 13th,2011 (she was like my daughter) and I was severely depressed to say the least. I wasnt sleeping at all and was just miserable. The following weekend  I decided to help my friend with a project she had undertaken....bad idea since I wasnt sleeping I was extra grumpy so my usual patient and calm demenor was non-existent. So I came across this Neuro Bliss in some far out store and it caught my eye. Can I say instant mood changer! It relaxed me and it was like I drank the stress away! I highly recommend it. Just even as a pickme up. and its yummy :-)	5	2

		A30ZF44DS2MMEV	Tasty	These almonds are the best. I love the tasted but was not quite as zippy or strong as I had hoped. I do eat lots of hot items so perhaps my taste buds are expecting more. Having said that, the flavor and freshness is tops.	0	0
		A3N8RB943DMSH7	Mate, more than an acquired taste	I have had mate in South America, the gourds packed full of leaves, but this was my first trial in the US.  I had hoped that the milder tea bag version might warrant reconsideration, but mate is really just horrible stuff.  Both my husband and I describe the taste as dirty and pungent.  Guayaki's flavored mate's warrant some consideration if you want the health benefits, but I would stay away from the original unless you really are a mate fan.	3	2
		A2W6YVTDIK998A	Order Extras	These peace signs looked great on my daughters birthday cupcakes.  My order arrived in broken pieces and the company promptly sent another order. It also had breakage but between the two shipments we had enough to cover all of our treats.  Order earlier then you need them.	1	0
		A147SS0ZPZPPFC	Alternative eats	The choco/almond Pure Natural Bar is a good energy alternative for times when one can't sit down for a real meal. I work from 8am-3pm at one job then ride my bike to my second job, 3:30-8pm. These bars are perfect to toss in my bag and eat at 5 or 6pm. The taste is perfectly ok, although I wouldn't be sorry if it had an even more chocolatey flavor. It's nice and moist, which my old standby, powerbars are not... Each bar is filling and satisfies hunger pangs. I wish a single bar wasn't so calorie dense, but that's probably due to all the nutty goodness, which is what provides the sustaining energy. So as long as one doesn't eat them by twos and threes, it's probably all good.	0	0
		A35Q0RBM3YNQNF	Healthy Barbecue Potato Chip Substitute	These soy crisps have a genuine barbecue potato chip taste that is a great substitute for the fatty calorie laden chip. I highly recommend them.	0	0
		A1K31E7YNVQRIT	A Good Cup of Coffee	This is a nice, somewhat mellow but rich cup of coffee. I like the packaging because I have had more than a few normal K-cups either explode or backfire in my Keurig. With this type of cup, the water has no place to go but out through the filter. It's pure genius if you ask me. I do prefer the Rainforest Blend to the Fogchaser from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company. I found the Fogchaser much more acidic and, though it could be a coincidence, my heart rate went to about 120 after 2 cups of Fogchaser. Of interest, the pack of 3 I received did not come in boxes with any descriptions on them. They were just 3 thickish cellophane bags with 12 cups in each, which I thought was strange because when I ordered the Fogchaser, each pack of 12 was in a box and I was able to give one as a gift to my coffee buddy at work. As for the coffee getting stale as others are concerned about, well.....coffee doesn't last very long around here. 12 cups goes in much less than a week and I have not noticed any staleness by storing these in my upright Keurig carousel. That's probably because this particular carousel does not leave the bottoms of the cups exposed to air. I digress. I do recommend the Rainforest Blend -- it's a great cup of coffee at a really good price. And less packaging to boot.	15	1
		ASD537RN0CAK8	Great for you, great tasting!	These bars are so good, they don't even taste like they are good for you! I have one mid-day as a great fill me up until dinner.	0	1
		A1NK2SF59YKURD	Center overpowering	I have a pretty picky taste in chocolate, and this bar did not meet my expectations.  Although the dark chocolate surrounding the minty center is satisfactory, the center is much too sweet and minty.  When you bite into the square, you get a nice chocolate flavor, but it is soon overrun by a proportionally large amount of filling with an incredibly minty and terribly sweet taste.  Additionally, there are way too many unnatural ingredients in this chocolate (especially part of the mint center), so I'm not a big fan on the health credentials of this either.	0	1
		A888JU6XVGRTP	Very Strange	I usually really like Numi teas, and I like just about anything that has lime, but I did not like this tea.  Unappetizing color, too.	0	0
		A1047OMXWCRX6Q	Artificial sweetener most likely Splenda.	"This is a super sweet tea that tastes like you're sucking on a ""red hot"" candy. Because none of the ingredients listed on the box are themselves super sweet, my best guess is that the ""artificial flavor""/AF listed on the box is Splenda.<br /><br />If the AF was Stevia, they wouldn't need an AF disclaimer because it is natural ingredient; if it contained the other two artificial sweeteners in the pink and blue packets, they would have to include a PKU disclaimer on the box, which they do not."	4	0
		A2A2MBYUNP4O54	Low price, still not worth it	With coffee prices going nuts, I decided to start trying a bunch of different ones to see if I could find something affordable and tasty. Chalk this one up as a failure. This stuff has no taste. Accidentally put too much in my machine, but decided to leave it in to see if that created flavor (plus I could use it up faster that way). The result was another bland pot of coffee. Definitely won't be buying this stuff again.	3	2
		A3J74RACXXOZZN	Wasa Critters	It's hard to put a *star rating on this.  I like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super.  They are hard to find in our local stores and I use Amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items.  However, this purchase experience was a little disappointing.  The crackers came quickly and in great shape...no breakage and the price was fine.  But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it's all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don't have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you can't save money if you toss everything that doesn't meet your approval.  Anyway, can't sieve crackers but I'm still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Don't want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.  This review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on Amazon.  Inspect them carefully, pop them in the freezer if in doubt, and enjoy.  The crackers get a 5-star rating; the purchase on Amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage.	3	2
		A2UWIWD56X2Z5O	The REAL Coconut Juice, the Healthier Alternative to Coconut Juice BLENDS with Sugar added.	If you have never drank coconut juice fresh from the coconut, you are missing one of Natures most refreshing drinks.  If your only experience is drinks served at Asian restaurants, you need to know - this is NOT the same thing.  Most places sell the cheaper - with sugar and water added - version of this drink.  I am so happy that AMY & BRIAN have stuck with the more expensive PURE coconut juice.<br /><br />It is definitely less sweet.  It will quench your thirst better.  You won't have to worry about the extra calories.  It's the real thing.  You will not want to share the can, so be sure to count all of the 2 servings of calories.<br /><br />I used to buy this by the case on Amazon, but sadly the price went way up (from $18) and I got cases with dented and leaking cans.  So $$ was not worth it.  I can not find it locally, and so am suffering with the sugary stuff again.  I wish the price would come down and shipping did not kill the cans.	1	0

		AXQFMPCPLAESY	Not worth the money	I bought one of these thinking I would try it out and go back for more if it worked out.  They are cute, but I won't be buying more.  The Stay-Fresh Baby Food containers are MUCH better and cheaper.  The Stay-Fresh containers each hold 2 ounces and can go straight in the microwave.  Once the food is frozen I find it difficult sometimes to get the portion of food out of the Beaba container.  Not the best design and totally overpriced.	2	2

		A21R2L5NY1WKP0	My son cannot eat them!	My son has a gluten and lactose intolerence and the box says these cookies are gluten free, non-dairy.  So my family would puchase them for my son to have a treat when he visits them.  However, everytime he eats these cookies he comes home with bad diarrea, lethargy, etc, like he ate wheat.  However on the back of the box it does have a dairy symbol so now I think that maybe there is some dairy in there that could be making him sick. I am not going to be giving them to my son anymore.  I'm so dissapointed in this product!	2	2
		A267CNXZTWED3N	Greenies	I've bought these greenies twice now from Amazon.  Amazon has one of the best prices on the Internet, but I still feel the product is way too expensive.  I'm now using a cheaper product from Walmart that is supposed to do the same thing so far as cleaning teeth.	0	0
		A23WE733QT4WGJ	Dogs devour it	I have two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Beagle.  They absoluey love this Grilled Sirloin. In order for them to chew it without devouring and not swallowing it, I mix it with their regular dry food. Calms them down a bit. It's not crunchy, it's softer dry food. Very moist. They had no adverse reactions to it either; no diarrhea etc.	0	0
		A1HJPH1DKEY9NM	definitely not my idea of xtra large	This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.	1	0
		A1S7ZABK2WVPTM	Have Some Crumbs!	This product tastes okay, but the packaging is ridiculous.  Three hundred 2-cracker cellophane packs were literally thrown into one, big box, with no padding, no partitions, and no expiration dates.  I got these for travel, for lunches to go, and for the convenience of not having remaining crackers go stale.  My family and I can't even enjoy these with spreads or slices of cheese, because all we have are pieces of crackers and crumbs.	2	0

		AYUF7YETYOLNX	A Decent Almond Snack, but It Pales to Marconas	"These are good nuts, my whole family was impressed with them.  That is, until we picked up Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4).  It was amazing, we would give these to guests and everyone said these were pretty good. Then we'd give them some Marconas and their faces would light up and say, ""The Cocoa almonds were good, but these are very good.""<br /><br />The Cocoa nuts have a nice rich chocolate flavor and crisp nuttiness. All in all they were good, but they didn't hold a light to the Marcona nuts. Maybe Emerald should make cocoa marconas.<br /><br />Once the Marconas were gone, our six year old made fairly regular covert trips to the kitchen to grab one of these.  So they were hit with him, although since his mom horded the Marconas to herself, he didn't know what he was missing.<br /><br />Definitely was a five star product before Marconas."	0	0

		A2EVB6GXS0AGN0	Nice aroma doesn't make up for acidic after-taste	Having read the glowing reviews on Amazon, I ordered this coffee with great anticipation.  However, my wife and I found this coffee very disappointing.  The after-taste of this coffee is not just strong, but strangely acidic and off-putting. Based on the reviews, we expected a full and rounded taste on the pallet, but the coffee tasted almost bitter in the finish.  At $25 a pound, I cannot recommend this.	1	3

		A1ZHBI0FDO3031	Tastes Good, Drink it all and it makes you VERY nervous	I Love the Blue Sky Energy Drink, Wild Berry Flavor, but was used to drinking the 8 oz size that I would buy at the grocery store, so I was very surprised to receive a whopping 16 oz size via Amazon. Since I was used to drinking the 8 oz size with no problem, I gave it no thought to drink the 16 oz. BOY was that a mistake. Not only did it make me VERY nervous, but it was entirely too much 'energy' for my system at once. From then on I only drank half a can at a time and I was fine. They should put a warning on this stuff. DO NOT DRINK A WHOLE CAN.	0	0
		ADLVFFE4VBT8	Good tea blend. Not 'the best there is' but it's more than decent	The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.	0	0
		A2S2TANUMLLUT5	Better than paying $1 per pack at the corner store	If you love this candy, then go ahead and buy this package. If you have no idea what this tastes like, don't bother. I bought a case because the price of the case versus each pack of candy worked out to much less than what I would pay at the store. The product was fresh and tasted even better than the ones that sit in vending machines for weeks.<br /><br />My only complaint/concern is that I ordered for this product in the middle of a heat wave, and consequently the little jelly candies had melted or burst a little in the bag, so they stuck together. Other than that, it just gave me a reason to eat them sooner.<br /><br />This is a good idea to buy if you want some Halloween candy or something to pack with your lunch as a little dessert.	0	0
		A3GYC6Y06A9J1X	Engineering flaw	My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split.	1	1
		A3DVBWC0CXH8DY	EfaGold Coconut Oil	I got this coconut oil for my baby's diaper rash because we use cloth diapers. I don't think it has been terribly effective for its intended purpose, as it doesn't really clear up the rash quickly. Also, it's very liquidy in even slightly warmer temperatures and tends to make a mess everywhere as it spreads upon contact with body heat.<br /><br />However, it smells very good, and I've used it in the kitchen for cooking as well.	0	9

		A1LU4P64N2IDA8	BUYER BEWARE!!!  A complete waste of money	I purchase a lot of products from Amazon. This is the first time I wanted to return an item and these are not returnable. The product is not sampling of the flavors but appears to be a box of all the flavors they couldn't sell individually. There are so many multiples of flavors I would never use (ie: 4 cinnamon, 3 peppermint, 2 watermelon), this is a complete waste of money. And, it didn't contain any of the flavors I most wanted to try.	5	4

		ATS7LYGLUX34L	Very Tasty, But Kind Of Small.....	I've never eaten Organic Chocolate before, and I often find Dark Chocolate to be somewhat bitter, so I was very interested to taste Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate. I found the taste to be surprisingly sweet and smooth, and I enjoyed it very much. The actual amount you get per bar seems very small for the price, however........But it is a fair-trade product, so that knowledge does go a long way towards justifying the price.	0	1
		AT9U5ZE5OO84C	Not my favorite but my college kid loves it	I was slightly (SLIGHTLY!) disappointed in this flavor.  I expected the chocolate to be more chocolaty.  Instead, the coffee was a little on the bitter side and it smelled much better than it tasted.  My college age daughter on the other hand, digs through all the flavors of K-cups to find this one flavor instead of hazelnut, vanilla and southern pecan.<br /><br />As for the person with grounds in her cup, look in the instruction booklet on how to clean the brewer.  If cleaning doesn't solve the problem, make sure you are using the machine properly (don't open the K-cup!).	4	1

		A1IPRUL5DBLO6Q	Very popular with my cats (but one problem)	I buy these dog treats for my cats and break them up to make them smaller.

Mostly his problemm, but I note he does not vomit other treats, so it's worth keeping an eye on the issue if you feed them.	0	1
		A2HMF8ZR67BNZS	Popcorn	We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.	2	1

		ATVJ9B2CANYLQ	Not happy with assortment...be careful	"I too am disappointed in my ""variety pack.""  I too think the description and pictures are misleading! Shame on you Amazon! I thought I was getting the assortment pictured with two surprise flavors.  I spent a lot of time looking at the pictures of different listings to figure out which assortment I wanted. I received the shipment, no real complaints there, but was disappointed that 40% was French Vanilla from two different companies. Out of 35 cups that's 40% of total. I also had 6 flavors I didn't like at ALL (Holiday leftover flavors like Pumpkin Spice and Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog).  Take 6 I don't like and didn't think I was getting (thought it was TWO random) and I really didn't save any money from buying in a store in town. I think the deception comes in the picture of k cups with two pictures of ""surprise"" flavors. I did go back and read the actual listing and to the sellers defense it says AT LEAST two random flavors.  First time Shame on ME, Second Time Shame on You AMAZON! The product SHOULDN'T be listed as a Variety Pack with specific pictures but rather listed as a GRAB BAG of random flavors from a variety of companies.  I will NOT purchase again as I am throwing away the six terrible flavors. Next time I will get with friends and have a swapping of flavors so I know what I am getting and not pay shipping!!"	6	0
		ALDYWG0CPSYUF	These make my life so much easier.	I bought these for my cat and his pills, but they work for my dogs, also.  They are easy to use, the pets like them (they really seem to think they are treats), and I don't have to disolve my cat's pills in a liquid or try to get them down his throat, or shoot them down his throat with a pill gun.  These really simplify my life.	0	0
		A14MSTXUI8DOPI	Love these	These fruit snacks are an excellent way to get fruit into your diet.  I'm a diabetic and a one bag serving is about 8-10 grams of carbs and that is it.  Because the carb count is so low, I do not need insulin and the effect on my blood sugar is negligable.  I know a low of people are upset that these are made in China, but for my purposes, they could be made in Saskatchewan for all I care.  I need the health benefit that the fruit provdies without all the carbs and if this works, I'll take it.  I buy these from Costco for a slightly cheaper price than Amazon offers them for (but not much).	0	0
		A1NXCXXMGIE0YX	Tastes like plastic	I love my Keurig, and use it several times a day. These K-Cups were the worst I have tasted. Grove square is one of the few brands that, for there coffee, uses a mix of micro ground and instant coffee. But since this review is for their apple cider, I will briefly tell you my opinion. The Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider is by far one of the worst drinks I have ever made in my Keurig. It hardly is apple cider. For Thanksgiving most of my family tried it and none of them even finished their cups. I will never buy any Grove Square product again. I have heard that Green Mountain Apple Cider is much better and I am sure would be worth buying.	0	0
		A34FGRZK561PBP	They have a strange taste. Much worse than baked Lays or Pringles.	I was disappointed with the taste of these chips (regular and barbecue). I can't really taste the potato, so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip. It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh, and it also has an odd chemical-like taste. The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty. My kids finally ate the rest of these chips, but only after all of the other chips were gone.	3	4
		A35VFHN7MMZ3A2	yellow spots	"I bought this for my mom as a gift.  It looked ok...at first just a little ""over watered"".  Instead of blooming it developed yellow spots and all of the leaves are dropping off.  It has a bacteria.  I would never buy this again.  Before I learned what the problem was she gave it back to me to try and fix.  I put it with my other gardenias and now I realize I may have contaminated my own plants."	6	2
		A1CKAZZ3Z647NA	Grandson's Favorite	I haven't been able to find this variety of Pop Tarts in the stores near us.  So I purchased online from Amazon, even though the quantity was large.  No problem.  My grandson absolutely loves this variety.  He chooses this as his dessert!	1	0
		A2LQQKWT4NROUW	the best way to fight insomnia without a crash	i've had insomnia for 5+ years. I used to be on meds like Ambien, Zoloft, and Elavil for the longest time. I also do have anxiety (hence the zoloft and elavil). I kissed all those meds goodbye when this tea came out. I don't reccommend you drink it while driving, cuz it did impair me many a time when i would drink it while i was out having dinner.<br /><br />It def does what is says. I've only tried the Green Tea & Honey - non carbonated bottle of tea. It tastes great, and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste at all. In fact, i don't even notice an aftertaste when i drink it.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Chamomile (reduces anxiety), Valerian (promotes relaxation), Passionflower (reduces anxiety), Hops (promotes relaxation and inhibits adrenaline), Melatonin (relaxes your muscles), and lemon balm (enhances mood, alertness & calm).<br /><br />This tea is better then any pill i've ever taken for my insomnia and anxiety. It's healthy and all natural. There is no crash afterwards like most drinks and meds. You will wake up refreshed.<br /><br />Drinking it will make you relaxed and laid back (mellow). You will most likely fall asleep. (This is on 1 bottle). I have done 2 bottles - they reccomend not going over 2 bottles, and if you drink 2 bottles to separate it by 8 hours from the last one. I drank bottle 2 after 3 hours of drinking the last one. i only made it thru a 1/4 of bottle #2 before i passed out in my bed. Doing 1 bottle is like equivalent to 1 5mg pill of ambien, but doing 2 bottles is like equivalent to 20-25mgs of Ambien (and the legal highest dose for Ambien i am told is 20mg), so 2 bottles is pretty strong.<br /><br />I love it, and i definitely reccommend it to other ppl who have anxiety and insomnia. I love it so much i want a month supply of it.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that it may contain kava kava as well, even though none of the bottles have this listed on it.	10	0
		A1Y1L56592H2ZX	Yes, it is edible but healthy??	Seriously?? By whose standards??<br /><br />Since when are wheat starch, glycerin, cellulose, potato starch, bacon flavor (?what does this mean?) healthy?<br /><br />I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.<br /><br />I love the nylabone chew products but I don't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats.	3	1
		A3I4PCBRENJNG2	quality lightly sweetened green tea powder	lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened.	0	0
		A3HPCRD9RX351S	Great Ingredients	Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.	2	0
		A2K4OAG41UD9GW	The best coffee I've ever had	This is hands down the best coffee I've ever tasted. I recently started experimenting with Turkish Coffee and feel like I'm discovering coffee for the first time. The Berber coffee presents a variety of complex flavors and spices that make each sip a moment of joy. I've also tried the Natashas' Cairo blend which is also an excellent choice. In addition to making these the traditional way in an Ibrik, I've had success making them in a French Press. Of course the Ibrik provides a little more flavor intensity.	1	0
		A291HTT117RVS9	Did I get a different soup than everyone else?!?	I love pretty much every tomato soup I've ever tried & like the Dr McDougall's brand, so this should have been a no-brainer. The first issue I had was with the smell, which was hinting at being rancid. I heated it and tried it, though, but the taste was no better. It tasted burnt and had no tomato-y flavor. I opened another one and ...same smell, so I threw them all out. Maybe I got a bad batch, but buyer beware.	2	0
		A1X0SODXXJPO7H	Dogs love them	Dogs will do ANYTHING for these treats. Owners beware: you will have to wash your hands after giving them as they are STINKY (the fish and venison flavor especially), and your dogs' breath won't be too pleasant for a while afterward. But for coaxing a dog to do something, these cannot be beaten.	2	0
		A8PT69KR65EEE	Really different - Really good	What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews, soups, etc. It keeps well - the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1, Heinz 57, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, etc as a condiment staple.	0	0
		AQNX0WN00JEVE	Was surprised	I received this item free for review.  I've got shoulder-length curly, frizzy hair.  Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The shampoo itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.  However, my hair doesn't look and feel nearly as good and the color is being stripped out of it with each washing.  I think I'm going to have to stop using it.  I've downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3.	1	0
		A3N041QAKY7BVW	Delish!	Juicy flavor and natural taste, yum!  Only complaint is that the color is intense - stains counters if you spill the powder and can stain teeth if you drink too much.  Wish Crystal Light used less coloring!	4	0
		A17V3UVYMI69TE	PUCKER UP	I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.	0	0
		A2IUXT71YHHULC	best and truthfull company	this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted. also the company truly gives an Orthodox Muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other Muslim company's who try do deceive the consumer.	3	0

		A19XBW5WUDH1Z	Raw Healthy Freeze dried snack ...but so expensive	Nature's Variety Snacks seem to have the right ingredients. My dogs were barely interested in the treats.<br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I've always known that cats need more protein than dogs.<br />Granted this is just a treat but I would think that is why few treats and designed<br />for dogs/cats. I was shocked to realize at the current price these treat cost over $43 per pound.<br />Why not save money and buy your pets Filet mignon or the finest wild Alaskan Salmon.<br />I'm exaggerating of course but I hope you get my point. You could buy a food dehydrator<br />and make your own beef or chicken treats for your pet.	0	0
		A38836H2CJT0PD	Disappointing	When I purchased this salt I was a little wary of its color but it was the only popcorn salt that was available at the time. I was highly disappointed in the flavor of it. I thought maybe the color was just there for color and it would still taste like salt, but it has a fake, off flavor. It reminds me of the taste of the artificial salt that my grandmother had. On the upside the texture of it was nice.	0	0
		A3JO2Z0L7GI9ES	very sweet!!	very sweet!!<br />it's got four packs in one go, and leak-free cap. Me and my family enjoyed the flavour, and the texture. I'd recommend this product to friends and neighbours.	1	1
		A2BN4MQDZIN4KT	Potato Styrofoam Tubes...	"These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless ""potato sticks"" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the ""sea salt"" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual ""fry""<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better."	1	0

		ASYKNDJYXTHOL	Good tea from a good company!	I really do enjoy this tea. It is very relaxing and stress relieving and does not take too long to take effect. It really is a very calming tea...although it can also be stimulating, it is dual directional...gives a small mood boost as well... The taste is both sweet and bitter because of the goji extract...<br />The taste is somewhat flat, but pleasant.	1	0
		A3FDTPTQ88DC6K	Delicious	I didn't buy this from amazon, but I just had it today and it's delicious! If you like the Chickarina soup you will love<br />this. It's almost a mexican version of the same thing. I cooked mine stove-top and add a little black and cyenne pepper, and<br />a dash of onion powder.	4	0
		A36MZGJVT077WL	Very Light	"I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the ""light roast"" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />""Light Roast"" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />""Extra Bold"" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a ""light roast"" coffee in an ""Extra Bold"" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite."	6	0
		A3FBWD7GKZ4KHY	Nice Smokey Maple Flavor	"I just bought this at Wal-Mart today. I put it on some nice pork I had cooked in my crock pot looking for that ""shredded pork with bbq sauce"" effect. It is thinner than your typical sugary sauce but that's nice because a little goes a long way. The flavor is smokey with an unexpected but nice maple flavor. I think I am going to try to add a little hot sauce next time. It's not exactly like a thick gloppy sugar laden sauce, but it does help the craving. I plan to buy it again."	0	0
		A3FON5KASMUGQU	Weak Flavor	I love k-cups. They're pretty cool, and I like the idea of them, but I don't like sacrificing the flavor just for the sake of a cup. The tea tastes very watered down for some reason. And I am a tea drinker who doesn't add sugar/honey because I enjoy the natural sweetening properties in the actual herbs. But this herbal tea is missing something, especially with a name like 'Authentic Green Tea'. It's pretty disappointing for the price of these things, but I'll continue to drink it until I run out.	1	0
		A3HEFJG02SGDG9	Subpar Coffee Beans	I don't know what happened, but these beans are not very good.  They are dry, fairly bland and just not what I come to expect from Coffee Bean Direct. My boss turned me onto Coffee Bean Direct (from now on referred to as CBD) about a year ago and I fell in love with the variety and freshness. Six months ago or so I found that CBD is now available on Amazon and was a very happy camper since I am a Prime member. The first five pounds I received were the same that I came to expect from the CBD roasters, but now on my second order, Costa Rican Tarrazu seems like they shipped some really old product that is very much past it's prime.  Maybe the CBD Costa Rican Tarrazu are not that popular and have sat in a warehouse waiting for some unlucky person like me.  I would throw them out if I hadn't spent so much on them, I don't even want to mix them with something else since I don't want to ruin another batch of good coffee.<br /><br />I hope it is just a fluke, but I'm not sticking around to find out, too much money to gamble.  I have now found another vendor for my fresh coffee addiction which is unfortunately a bit more expensive, however it IS fresh, oily and so tasty.	0	0
