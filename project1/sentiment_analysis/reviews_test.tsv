1	B000SDKDM4	A1NE47S8ZJPLR3	Smooth coffee	"My built-in Bosch coffee machine has trouble grinding ""oily"" beans, because they get caught in the chute and don't reach the grinder.<br /><br />When using oily beans, the message ""add beans"" appears even if the hopper is full, and I have to slide out the chasis and stir the beans.<br /><br />The Lavazza beans are ""dry,"" without an oily sheen, and I haven't had any problems making my afternoon espresso, plus the coffee is smooth and there is plenty of cream or crema on top.<br /><br />All in all, a great product at a great price, and retail stores I've visited charge a lot more for the same coffee beans."	0	0
1	B000MS6CK2	A1GV419L0C3AJY	awesome	"An absolute ""must have"" item for your Bloody Mary bar collection. No Packer, Badger, or Brewers game pre-game tailgate is complete without Bloody's, and your bloody isn't complete without this (if you like 'em spicy). A good flavored hot-sauce without being obnoxious."	0	0
1	B0030F70LO	A8EJ2H1P3ELL3	Great treat for bigger dogs	I have a Great Dane & most treats are gone in the blink of an eye, but these Sweet Potato Chew Treats actually last a little bit. She loves them so much & starts drooling anytime I get the bag out. Highly recommend.	2	1
-1	B001EO6GJK	A34R5COY8PP3LE	Disappointing - more like candy than fruit	I got turned on to dried mangoes from the ones available at Costco, which are great.  Compared to those, these are disappointing.  Only slight mango flavor, and is overly sugared - has the taste and texture of candy rather than dried fruit.	0	1
1	B004SRH2B6	A23H9F74EMOXEF	Good Product !	I enjoyed the product, good taste, good quality. I purchased it on sale and without paying S&H, it will be overpriced if I have to pay everything, will purchase again next time is on sale :-)	0	1
-1	B007M832YY	A1B2UXUU1H9CPT	Not so good	After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due.	0	5
1	B001AHJ2D8	A2XXTGHE0YVZSZ	good-tasting snack	The texture of this chip is firm, solid, substantial, and minimally crispy. The taste is rich with favors of different seeds and grains. It seems that the inclusion of sesame seeds, in particular, makes this chip especially aromatic and pleasing to the taste.	1	0
-1	B002HFLHEE	A2OAYU1SUQC94X	Using because Dr Oz said	I'm drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but that's because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools.	0	0
-1	B001PNJJTY	A25OGQSPLKZZ6X	Not so great	This dip mix is too salty, and it tastes more like onions than anything. You can achieve the same results from a package of onion soup mix and some sour cream..... I used it once, and the rest of the container is sitting in my cupboard. Don't bother.	0	0
1	B001OCKIP0	A1DBCHREMYNOVT	Delicious!!	I love this amazing product.  I eat it daily in coffee yogurt or in natural vanilla yogurt.  I love the crunch with a bit of chocolate.  I am fortunate that I do no have to order this item online here.  I can find it MUCH cheaper at my local grocery and then sometimes even cheaper when on a B1G1 sale.  Anyway, I love the product!	0	0
1	B000ER1ER2	A2RERXI7RH3CIA	A favorite	We have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year-old daughter won't eat anything else.  She will always eat these.  Her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too.	3	0
1	B002J9J8QC	A1MJSTBNK02AMD	Great find	I know they had discontinued this item, but every time I would go to the supermarket my bf would look for this, because he lovvvves this stuff. So i did some homework and was glad to find this! Now my bf can rest easy because he has his Reese's peanut butter...at least for a little while.	1	0
-1	B002UZW4LG	A37QJWE66FPM3F	Not The Best	Being one of only six people in the world that eat and likes fruit cake, I was disappointed in this product. It has alot of fruit in it but the cake is dry and crumbly. My wife who hates fruit cake likes it, does this tell the story?	2	1
-1	B000FPKX48	A30D44GWCCCQ6N	Worse than airline food	Describing this as airline food would be an insult to airline food. Mushy, flavorless. You would be much better to make your own, or find an adult ravioli with flavor and kid-friendly ingredients. Now, I am reluctant to try any of the Gerber Graduates.	0	0
-1	B001BORBHO	A2KIZ2NOQMVN1J	Dog Food was excellent - but, don't count on it...	Our dog has many allergies, and - finally - we found a dog food that he can tolerate.  Happy Days!!  But, Wellness wasn't selling enough of the Salmon and Rice - so, they took if off the market.  No Warnings, no advice to begin to seek out an alternative - just, gone.  He is now vomiting on the Wellness replacement - and we're seeking yet another alternative - but, it won't be from this company.	0	2
-1	B004ITSENY	AYMM2NPVDQB4F	TOO SMALL	I am very disappointed in what I received today... I expected a larger bag and these bones are nothing for a chocolate lab.  very disappointed that Old Mother Hubbard does not have large wheat free biscuits for big dogs.... End of story!	1	5
1	B004SKPQWU	AY57E8Z4CSIHO	2 year old loves it!	My daughter has been eating this since she was about 13 months old, and she has always loved it. She loves all the flavors...very convenient, too!	0	0
-1	B001D9JC0G	AH5NKAG8839T8	Something's Changed with Canidae food	I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats.	15	3
1	B002MZAJ0M	APNOO4OJ72OND	Delicious	This is tasty stuff. Very creamy and smooth. It cooks in my microwave perfectly in 2:50. I just add a teaspoon of honey and enjoy. My wife loves it too. Economical  in the 6 pack sold here on Amazon.	0	0
1	B001PQOB4O	AIXHGKPPPCHXE	Best Cornbread, Costco is crazy	Costco carried this particular brand of cornbread for many years, but appears to have stopped carrying it.  Big mistake.  This is hands down the best cornbread period.  It is moist and sweet.  Almost cake-like.  Perfect with Chili or Pork BBQ Country Ribs.	2	0
1	B0049OPXP0	A6YBIKBMW67UH	The best gluten free bread I've found	I've tried several other brands of gluten free bread for sandwiches and UDI's is by far the best. Similar consistency to wheat bread and good tasting, not too sweet like many of the others I've tried.	0	0
-1	B006N3HWGS	ALMJSJ9L82QBL	Price increase...whoa!!	I love this tea but not enough to purchase at this new inflated price. It is now over $20 more than when I last purchased it from Amazon. I'll find a new tea, thank you. That's insane.	0	0
1	B004391DK0	A1G7SVHXVQM1K4	Love my Bisquick from Amazon	You won't miss your old waffle/pancake mix when using this wonderful product.  I mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles.  Pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix.	0	0
1	B0041LHND6	A161CMP3P70EY3	Happy Dogs!	"Much better choice than last years ""turkey leg"" chew.  This style allows the dog much more chewing time as the big end of the leg got in the way and only allowed about 1/4 of the surface to be chewable."	0	0
-1	B001A5ZCY8	A20JRDCHBHO1MH	too sweet	What do they add?  Is it the marshmallow root?  (There's no stevia.)  This tea has a sickening sweetness all its own.  If you accidentally bought it, like me, here's a tip:  try adding lemon juice to your cup just so you can use up the box without throwing it away.	5	0
-1	B0026RQTGE	A1MX0D09ZKQNZO	Dog goes crazy for these	EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.	0	0
1	B000I1RHMU	A3BFXN08J3UCGL	Great green tea !	This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup.	0	0
-1	B006N3I18Q	A2QE1QQ5T4GBMQ	Strong icky fake vanilla taste	I bought this item after reading great reviews.  I did not like this coffee at all.  Maybe it's because I really like Dunkin' Donuts vanilla coffee.  Or the Starbucks vanilla lattes.  This coffee has a fake vanilla taste to it that has quite the bite and leaves a horrible taste in your mouth.  Some people like this coffee, but it's really not for me.  If you ever had the trader Joes vanilla creamer, it tastes similar to that, which I am not a fan of either.	0	0
1	B007IK5QZO	A2CONAEHLBSX57	Great	I use this in cooking and also as a skin care product. First time that I have tried olive oil as a moisturizer and I absolutely love it. This is one brand that I will buy again.It is great and gentle on the skin.	0	0

1	B002ANA9QA	A2AY984OZU6ZMB	Great Food for your Dog!	I have been feeding this to my two small dogs for the last few years and they have been doing super well! They don't have any health problems and they are nice and trim! Definitely recommend it!	0	2
1	B005NYXE1U	A7QNBFHFTTJ5T	A lot of candy	"Sent this to my brother who is serving in Afganistan.  His initial response was,""dude it's a lot of candy"".  He also said it was a great assortment of candy from when we were kids.  I didn't get to see the item myself so I hope that helps."	2	1
-1	B000MANIMK	A37DIC84EWVPPC	Somewhat greasy for Jolly Time	Update: I am very happy with Amazon's customer service! I tried another serving of popcorn and it was quite greasy, I thought how are we going to eat all of this? I contact Amazon Customer Service to see if a return of the unopened products was possible, unfortunately not but they automatically offered a refund without me even asking. Was very pleased with this and will end up donating the 11 boxes of unused/unopened product.<br /><br />I was excited to see Jolly Time listed for subscription offering as my husband and I really enjoy the 94% fat free version we find in the market. The description said it was a white popcorn and seemed to be pretty healthy as it had no butter. When we popped it, it was a little greasy tasting instead of light. It left a little grease on the paper towel it sat in. Unfortunately not too pleased with this but we bought a supply so will have to eat it/give it away!	0	1
1	B000BF3AL0	A24QSRYQSFIHW6	Glad I found them	By way if the Worthinton web site I found vega links on Amazon.  Eureka!!  I never knew.<br />I wish I didn't have to order a case, but very happy with a childhood favorite	0	0
-1	B001LGGH40	A17771LTRWSKQ5	Good but not out of this world	"It is a good concept to carbonate juice.  The kids loved it and called it ""soda"".  It has a nice flavor but it is difficult to taste the individual fruit juices though."	0	0
1	B007M83302	A1ONCPHCQIWQN7	Pop Chips	Lower in calories and great taste.  I like them just as much as the regular greasy chips.  It's nice to have a great tasting healthy alternative.	0	0
-1	B004867T24	A1H8JUI9GNQKNR	The product is great, but the price.  Really?	"I was a little worried about trying this with my cat because he's only ever had regular cat food or traditional treats before and I didn't know how he'd react to something like this.  I needn't have worried.  He inhaled these tuna ""treats"" like they were candy.  I hesitate to call them treats though because one ""stick"" of the tuna is about the amount of a regular single meal for my cat.  Anyway, I was going to come on here and write a review saying how I'd continue to buy these for my cat.  Except that's when I saw the price.  My poor cat is going to have to stick with his Whisker Lickins tarter control treats.  I can afford those and he likes them almost as well anyway.  Sorry, Buddy.  You're not a rich cat."	0	0
1	B000LQORDE	A20POWX7BHV85Q	Good!	Just got my first order delivered yesterday, and they're really quite good! I haven't had the authentic, from-Korea ramyun (yet!) but this is much better than any ramen or other instant noodle you'll find in any typical American super market. The noodles are thicker, which means that you can cook them to the right degree (just until firm, not mushy) MUCH more easily than other brands of American noodle. It's really not that spicy, just enough to clear up your sinuses, and it's not a spicy-for-the-sake-of-it kind of spicy, it's really quite full of deep flavors. I prepare it as per the directions on the packaging except I reduce cook time by 25-30 seconds and, when they're done, I crack one or two eggs into the pot after I bring it off the burner. The residual heat in the pot is more than enough to cook the egg, you just have to remember to break up the yolk and stir the egg around the pot. It helps to thicken the soup as well, which means it tends to stick to the noodles much better.<br /><br />Overall, the noodles are quite delicious, and the best American-made noodle I've ever had. I definitely recommend them.	2	2
1	B001O2DE1U	A36MP37DITBU6F	For all ages! Got these for grandbabies & I plus my 8 & 11yr old  LOVE THESE  ORGANIC BANANA  FLAVORED CRIPSY PUFFS	My whole family loves these. Not just for babies. These are wholesome organic snacks. If you love bananas, then these are an excellent snack.<br />Great for the whole family any age. I plan to have these as a staple snack in our home.	1	0
-1	B001E5DRPA	ANCT0IWDGUWTX	Too sweet and packaging flaws	"OK, we love the apples in this line, but the pears are just too sweet and the packaging was not able to keep the pears from crushing into dust.  At first, the order arrived and all of the bags were just crushed to pieces.  I called Amazon and they were GREAT and sent me a replacement; however, the second batch wasn't much better which made me think it was the composition of the pears that crumbles during shipment.  The taste is too sweet, which is surprising since there is nothing in there except pears!  I prefer the apples in this line, and if you are looking for a great snack this is perfect.  I love to give them to my toddler (one bag = one apple!) as a snack when we are on the go.  And my fifth grader loves them in her lunch - they are what the ""cool"" kids have as they are a bit pricy (but come on what would you rather spend $1.25 on...organic apples or some high fructose junk which you know you'll end up buying in those little packs that cost twice as much per oz.!)<br /><br />So bottom line - love the crispy apples, pass on the pears unless they revamp the recipe and get a new pear variety."	1	1
1	B0026RQTGE	A3LIZY8BL6XPCO	Terrific Product for Doggie Breath!	"The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the ""bricks & mortar"" stores; and I plan to order another box.  We received the product a few days after placing the order.<br /><br />Terrific product, and our lab loves this treat!"	2	0
-1	B004FGWU9O	AGDLI9B52XZYC	The WORST coffee !	The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!!	0	2
-1	B001OKDYFI	A2H15THH4YHODA	Caused digestive issues in dog with delicate system	My dogs loved these.  However, I started to notice a correlation between providing these to my dogs and digestive flare ups in one of my dogs whose system is more delicate.  She was having experiences bordering on diarrhea several times a month.  Once I stopped giving her these treats, the problem went away.  So, I would advise others not to purchase them.	0	0
1	B000TK6LBS	ACGV1Z965LP1J	One of my favorites	This is consistently one of my favorite cups of coffee for my Keurig. Not too bold, not too light, just a good regular cup of coffee that this regular guy likes.	1	0
-1	B0010VSBPO	A2L3XMOB67N4JM	Old Stock	Chex Mix Trail Mix is one of my favorite flavors, the low rating has nothing to do with the product.  Rather it has to do with the freshness of the items I received.  When you purchase food by the case I just expect it to be fresh.  Instead what I got was 3 months from the expiration date and it tasted like it.  If you find a similiar Chex Mix item locally it will most likely have a freshness date almost a year out.  I will think twice before buying anymore food items from Amazon.	7	3
-1	B007TJGZ0Y	A3FXK6HXI0MR5X	Sajia	I expected it little bit different than it tasted. Stronger than I like my coffee to be. I would not recommend this to people who does not like strong coffee	0	0
1	B002LANN56	AHQRU3MRORIWQ	Our dogs love this food!	If it was only up to our dogs, they would eat this all the time. They have always come when it is time to eat, but with this one, they seem to come faster. We usually feed beneful, but even the picky one comes running for this brand. I can't really objective judge what is appealing to dogs -- they have different sense perception, but they seem to prefer this, and we are not usually too picky about what we get them, either.	0	0
1	B000EW0XFQ	AY3CJF59RRYAF	Apple and Cinnamon	I bought these for my son because they are gluten free. He seems to like them. I thought that they lacked taste. I would have preferred a little more cinnamon taste.	1	0
1	B004W7T9VI	A50LD8D1QDXLU	Addicted!!!!	This tea is amazing. I drink it iced with sugar and lime. It will blow your mind. The taste is similar to a flavor of kool-aid that I had as a child. I can just drink glass after glass of this tea.	0	0
-1	B007P2NA7Q	A3QPAFAJ4R8JMP	No good	First of all it was mostly a bag of broken pieces and crumbs.  They were the thickness of a cracker and bland (stale) tasting.  I wouldn't waste the money.	0	0
1	B00859FH7O	A10PV6AP8SXEDI	This filter works PERFECT!	"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!"	472	5
1	B004JLCRLG	A2KRP8LCJGQ8EJ	Delicious tea, perfect little gift	"I bought these 10-packs to include in Christmas gifts and they were a hit! The tea is delicious (you can read my review of the full-sized package) and this is a nice way to introduce someone to this outstanding chocolate-mint tea. The size makes them perfect for inclusion in a basket of goodies or as part of a ""care package""."	0	0
1	B001AYEUH4	A3515MOXS3YDM1	Shipping is ridiculous!	You can purchase this directly from San-J for at least $2 less per bottle. They charge actual Published Shipping Rates based upon weight and distance. For instance it is $12.97 to ship to CA or $10.01 to ship to Alexandria, VA.	8	1
-1	B000J3FPSK	A2JSBKQ4OC698Z	Not like they used to be	Sadly I ended up discarding the unused tablets. Very weak flavor, I had to use 2 or 3 tablets for a glass of water. Also artificially 'sweetened' so be prepared to add some more sweetener of your choice. Not what they used to be, which is sad and strange considering the original recipe was a winner for decades! But someone had to improve it, and in the process destroyed a classic. Save your money, and treasured memories. Pass this one up.	6	2
-1	B001IQ1ITM	AN07CCGSEAP9	Interesting Product	It was a different texture and not bad tasting when I used it in a recipe.  Only downside, it went through me and came out the other end looking like it did when I ate it the day before...disgusting!  Didn't digest at all.  Good to use to clean out the intestines but too extreme for me.	0	1

-1	B000IEHRLS	A1XI9R4H2TXBJM	Disappointed	Klein's Natural's Dried Cranberries as described do not mention sugar as an ingredient. For this reason I purchased a six-pack box only to discover upon reading the list of ingredients on the bottom of a container that sugar was listed second.  As one who needs to watch my sugar intake I find this disappointing.	7	0

1	B0031UBXDE	A1CHUZ94IWYKZV	Looks and smells gross, but my baby wouldn't stop eating it!	Our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120% of daily iron needs.  Well, when I sat down to feed it to my baby, all I could was, wow, this is so gross!  It looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out, if you know what I mean.  To my surprise, my picky eater gobbled it up!  She ate more of this than any other baby food flavor we had offered.  A 2-3oz package of anything else was lasting two days, but she ate almost the whole 3.5oz package of this in one sitting.  I did taste it, and the apples make it sweet and appetizing (and I really do not like spinach).  We've had more success with Ella's Kitchen than any other brand, but this flavor especially has been great.  Looks gross, smells gross, sounds gross, but I say, give it a try.	0	0
-1	B000MXEN9O	A2TPGQ75HLOEFT	Too hard and too big	I bought these for my almost 9 month old twins. I was totally shocked by how hard these wagon wheels were. I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items.	0	0
-1	B000W5SLB8	A3EVY0GKKB6EI6	I think this made my dog sick - bad batch?	"Ever since I opened the newest bag of ""Taste of the Wild,"" my dog has not wanted to eat it.  The pellets look much different than usual, and the food does not smell good.  My dog rejects it, and when he does eat a little, he looks very unhappy about it.  He has been vomiting multiple times per day since eating this new bag of food.  Through a process of elimination, I have come to the conclusion that this newest bag of food is making him sick.  Although my dog used to love this food, I have lost faith in the brand and will not be ordering any more."	2	0
-1	B001LDAE4C	A2SDZ362NF1LWS	Not the real one again :-(	"Of course, the problem that we have, my wife and I, is the fact that we are Belgians and lived the first 25 years of our lifes in Liege (born and raised). So when I get pearl sugar online for our Liege waffles, like this one, pretending to be ""belgian pearl sugar"" (it's written on the box!), we can only be disappointed. I guess it's good enough for those who never been in Belgium or those who just passed by there...Those swedish made pearl sugar - at least they are not the rocky sugar - are too big, melt during cooking, give a taste of caramel instead, making the waffle chewy. Oh well...I'm sure one day we'll find the real belgian pearl sugar somewhere online..."	17	2

One serving is 3 points on the WW point system and you can have 18-22 chips, depending on the flavor you choose.  Very good!	1	0

1	B001ELLB4S	A2MTDUL8EMM6PG	Easily digestable & delicious!	I was very pleased with the shake. I sometimes mixed it with water and rice milk. Based on the other reviews I went slowly so not to get too much fiber at once. I go easy with anything to change digestion. But it is really good. I eventually used less and mixed it with the hemp protein, since that has less flavor. Because of my LBS and low protein absorption I was having a difficult time finding the product for me.

-1	B0061IUIDY	A2M9D9BDHONV3Y	Very weak English Breakfast flavor!	This is the second Higgins & Burke tea that I have tried and I am not impressed.  I find the flavor rather flat and weak even if I steep the teabag for a long time.  I have tasted some really great teas in all the years I've drank teas but this is not one of them.  From the written description I really thought this tea would be great but it's not.  It isn't bitter or acidic tasting but it is blahhhhhh.  I'll use up my remaining tea bags since I like to drink plain hot water but I will not be buying any more of this brand.	0	0

It really depends on the batch, but you get a bit of both in each package (ratios vary per package).<br /><br />Dates go perfect with nuts.  whether it's walnuts or almonds, but I found ""blue diamond oven roasted sea salt almonds"" to be a perfect match.  I stuff each date with 1 or 2 almonds, and I get a perfect combination of sweet and salty .. try it!<br /><br />This is an excellent snack that has lots of fiber, and it tastes great!"	0	0

-1	B001VJ3JTS	A15MWT0Z22ABDV	My cat hates it	I decided to change my cat's food to one that is labeled as specifically for seniors as my cat is 12+, and I thought this food had to be better for his age. There appeared to be good reviews of the product on other sites from owners of picky cats. My cat won't eat it. I tried to go the 25% mix, then 50% mix, up to 75% then full 100% change. He still won't touch it and waits until he can go outside to eat the regular Friskies I leave out for the strays. I believe that the levels for the Friskies is close to what is listed on this bag, so I'll save my money and stick with the Friskies for him. My review is not based on my opinion of the product, but what I perceive as my cat's opinion.	0	0
1	B001EPPCYY	A3C1L0V28IZ3XI	Yum yum good	I was trying to make cake pops that look like watermelons (red on the inside with chocolate sprinkles and then green coating) so I wanted the cake to taste like watermelon. This worked PERFECT. It's not overwhelming, I mixed it with a gluten free cake mix because I have several coworkers with celiac, it was great. Decently priced (I couldn't find watermelon extract elsewhere so maybe I'm wrong) and super convenient.	0	0

-1	B008I1XPKA	A17Y289WZ3K9AC	I am a Starbucks extra Bold Roast kind of girl, so keep that in mind.	French Roast<br /><br />I love French Roast in general, so I started my variety pack with a Brooklyn Beans French Roast.  I made it as I usually make my K-cups (I drink Van Houtte Eclipse almost every morning) and used a 6 ounce cup of water.  I don't use sugar and do use coffee cream.<br /><br />It smelled good, but when I poured cream in, went super white almost immediately, which usually means the k cup is not going to be a strong enough taste for me.  I want to find a Brooklyn Bean product I like, because they are very reasonably priced.  In any case, it won't be French Roast.  I poured it out.  Too weak for me on six ounce setting.<br /><br />Cyclone<br /><br />My son said I was going to like this one but he likes Starbucks blonde roast.  He really liked it.  I thought it was ok.  It didn't turn completely white with a bit of cream but it's just not full flavored enough for me.<br /><br />That said, I am sure someone who is not as into very strong coffee as me, will like it.  It's not bad, or anything, its just I am a Starbucks extra bold kind of girl, so remember that when you read my reviews.  Interesting though that two of my favourite K cups (other than double black diamond) are Caribou regular (I don't like the mahogany which is supposed to be stronger tasting) and the Eclipse, both of which are sort of medium smooth coffees.  Looking forward to trying and reviewing some more (I recently learned about reviewing on amazon when my cousin Joanne Levy wrote a book 'Small Medium at large' and I reviewed it because I liked it so much!	1	1
1	B004N807RG	A1M7W0234UOLVN	Lovely taste of Spain!	This is the most delightful olive oil I've ever tasted! Don't even think about using it in your cooking... it would be wasted. This is an olive oil you can, and should, use for dipping. It's sweet and fruity, with just the right hint of acid. There is a tiny, very delicate, wisp of spice, and there's no bitterness whatsoever. I highly recommend this olive oil! Spanish olive oils are my favorite--particularly from arbequina olives--and this one does not disappoint..	0	0
1	B003EM7J9Q	A24R0BELN03LIK	Great quick snack	I have been eating these for years. They are quick to microwave, tasty and not terribly bad for you.<br />I first found them about 10 years ago on a local grocery store shelf. Soon after, they were gone from the stores for some reason. Found them on Amazon a few of years ago, and have been ordering them ever since. Always good.<br />Tip: Make sure you store them at a reasonable temperature. I let some get too warm in my luggage, and they sort of spoiled before I could micriwave them.	0	0
-1	B000EEZ3LI	A23KRMRIW53GJP	Salty sardines	True, I am not a person who loves huge amounts of salt on everything, but I found the salty taste of these overwhelming. Despite the tomato sauce, they also felt dry. Go figure!I will try the olive oil version next.	0	0
1	B000H23ZE4	A214ZFJF8YNC15	Yum	These are very good.  They taste much better than the grocery store variety.  They are so good, by daughter requested that I order more.

-1	B0002ARQYQ	A32KYESZRIM4MB	noisy	the concept of the buster cube is great, it makes getting food fun for the dog. the only, yet very significant problem is that if you use it on hard floors it makes a ton of noise that's pretty much unbearable. and if you use it on a carpet it leaves crumbs. there are other products identical to the buster cube's purpose in dispensing food that way that are made of rubber.	0	0
-1	B0029NMQO4	A12XFNFOTHUDVW	cans dented, crushed	I have been buying this for some time and a few cans<br />were dented.  The last shipment (which will be my<br />last shipment) was really bad.  Out of the 24 cans I would only use 7 cans.  Since these are overwrapped in<br />packs of six, the damage must have happened before the overwrapping was done, since there is no way the dents<br />and crushed cans could have happened during shipping. When I was buying this dog food at the supermarket there would be dented cans on the shelf, but I didn't have to buy them. I didn't expect cans to be so badly damaged when they were being shipped direct from factory.	0	0

1	B00315WGNK	A2UR44HF5K9FE5	good Amazon value	whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this brand at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW - Target's $1/oz house brand Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1/oz.  One annoying thing about the package - the ingredients list is microscopic - sort of makes you wonder what they are hiding...	0	0

As such, I thought I'd try their New England Style Corn Chowder. It was good. I enjoyed it. But, for the same price, I'd prefer their fish and shellfish soups' The sodium content is way to high, in my estimation, and then they say you can add salt if you like. This was an acceptable soup, but I probably won't buy it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson	1	0

-1	B001E5E3FS	A16AXQ11SZA8SQ	A+ for nutrition; D for taste...	I eat this cereal daily because it's natural and nutritious, has plenty of fiber (10 grams per serving), and is very filling.  Unfortunately, the taste and texture is a lot like cardboard.  However, adding 1/2 cup of fresh/frozen fruit and 1 teaspoon of raw sugar makes it much more palatable (even delicious), without making it unhealthy.  After eating this for breakfast, I find it easier to get through my day without snacking.	11	2

I love it, less than two minutes in the microwave and you have hot, crispy and fresh (key here...some of the already puffed ones in stores are stale) chicharrones, or pork rinds.  I found these on a health food site and couldn't believe it, so I ordered a box.  They are really yummy and as long as you don't overindulge, you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty (and low in carbs!).	28	3
-1	B006BXUYN8	ABNMD6670TV53	Eh...	These are nothing to write home about. There is not much peanut butter flavor and the chocolate is so-so. These are very chewy compared to most granola bars, so you won't get much crunch in your bite. The bars are small and do not compare with other granola bars in terms of consistency and flavor. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, I recommend the Oh Yeah! Good Grab bars instead. They have much more flavor and more protein.	0	0

1	B005VOONKI	A1W78VPTNJJOF0	Coffee to take with you	These are those little coffee pouches that you get at a motel where they have single cup drip coffee makers. Alternatively, you can add hot water to a cup and mess with the pouch with a spoon, use a French press, or a small drip coffee maker. (It is kind of weak in a regular drip coffee maker.)<br /><br />Unlike some of the motel products, this coffee is very good.<br /><br />The pouches make it really convenient. For traveling, these will be perfect when you want just a cup and don't want to go out or go to a lot of trouble. However, I would mostly use this for traveling and only occasionally at home, since there is a lot of excess packaging that gets thrown away.	0	0

1	B001LG940E	AH9MUK2Z52V6N	Very good cherry taste, but a little too sweet	My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Strawberry Kiwi) flavor.  I found the cherry taste: noticeable taste without being overpowering.  My husband did not agree with me and thought the Kiwi flavor was better.<br /><br />I did find this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  It would probably be delicious in a mixed drink or with lemon-lime soda as a spritzer, but I didn't have any hand to try it out.<br /><br />Although I found it flavorful, I probably would not buy this drink, and especially not as a substitute for soft drink for the kids.	0	0

-1	B006QQ2P3M	A37IHGT3RE4V8A	A waste of money and time for me...BUYER BEWARE!	So, I have never been moved to write a negative review for Amazon but felt forced to with this waste of money and time...Having been a person who has had vivid dreams in the past and keeps a daily dream journal, I was very excited to receive this herb after all that I have read. The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly. BUYER BEWARE!	2	4

1	B000VYD0MA	A28UQB9MO5XNO9	Works perfectly	We have had an ongoing gopher problem in our yard since we neighbor a large hillside. Our nicely landscaped yard and moist soil is a buffet for gophers.<br /><br />We have tried the following with a mediocre success rate:<br /><br />1) Ultrasonic repellants (battery or solar powered stakes) - This may keep them from creating a burrow under your yard, but it doesn't keep them from eating your grass at night. Waste of money.<br /><br />2) Castor oil pellets and spray (Sweeney's) - Seems to deter them if your grass is freshly sprayed. A hungry gopher will still find roots to eat and will still tear up your yard in the process. It also is an ongoing process to apply this stuff and doesn't make your yard smell to good. For the price and effort, not recommended.<br /><br />3) Smoke bombs (Giant Destroyer) - These work if you catch the gopher red-handed and quickly insert the smoke bomb in the active hole. Also, If you have a network of tunnels in your yard and find a main runway you may kill some gophers as well. The problem is that a gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the tunnel and return to it's burrow. However, I still keep these on hand in case the situation calls for it.<br /><br />4) Flooding - this may work in some cases you can drown the gopher or it will dig its way out and catch the end of your shovel. For a gopher invading your yard it will only slow it down and cause it to dig in other spots. Gophers design their tunnels in a way that their burrow is protected against flooding. You also make a big muddy mess in most cases.<br /><br />5) Rototiller - This is a sure way to evict gophers if you are starting from ground zero. be sure to keep a shovel handy since they will run for cover. This is good for new yards since it will break down any existing tunnel system. If you are planting sod be sure to lay chicken wire a few inches below the sod. Gophers love grass roots.<br /><br />Once you have an established landscape that is being compromised by gophers - the best thing to use is:<br /><br />6) TRAPS! -  If you dig up a gopher mound and find a tunnel, the gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the opening or push dirt out as it continues to dig up your yard. By placing this trap IN an active open tunnel you will catch the gopher as it pushes dirt out. This is the best solution I have found.<br />A few tips:<br />  a) Tie a string or wire to the trap and the other end to a stick or some sort of anchor. This way you can pull the gopher out since it will try to retreat when it's trapped.<br />  b) cover the hole with a bucket or box to block the light. Gophers are sensitive to light and it may choose to plug up the tunnel and not approach the trap.<br />  c) I have a low tolerance for dead rodents and choose to throw the trap away with the dead gopher. Considering the time and money I spend on my garden, $5 for a dead gopher is a small price to pay.<br /><br />We are currently enjoying a gopher free garden without poisons and smelly repellents. I highly recommend this or other similar wire traps.	6	0

It was very dry in large lumps--not at all the even distribution of cereal I had expected and have always found in Kashi's boxes for the last several years.  I don't know if this was a shipping problem or a product problem.	1	2
1	B005OTJWPG	A1OV4TWOK0MSQJ	Fantastic Fruitables Skinny Minis - Pumpkin & Mango Dog Treats	This soft chewy dog treats which carries only 3.5 calories per pc is really great for my miniature schanuzer(this breed tends to put on weight rather easily). He simply loves it and at the same time, I could also keep his calories intake low. Will definitely recommend this treat to dog lovers out there.	0	0
-1	B000BRR8VQ	A1Y1ZEAVQPTCR7	Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas	I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up.	0	0

1	B0029NIFXK	A24MTH7QZV0VNK	My cats love this.	My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.  I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.	0	0

-1	B000F6UMHU	A32YUBZHE4ND5H	Extremely sweet, but O.K.	"Betty Lou's Coconut Macadamia Balls would be a much sought after snack at our home if only they were not soooooo sicky sweet.  I do realize that probably a lot of people love ""food"" that is that sweet.<br /><br />At our house, we do not consider snacks that have a large dose of natural sweetness to them in need of excess agave and stevia to make them taste like pure candy.  We would definitely eat these snacks regularly if they tasted like the coconut and macnut, instead of like concentrated sweeteners!<br /><br />Try the Spirulina Ginseng Balls! They are AWESOME and very well liked, even by our children. The Spirulina Balls are also great for energy, and you know you are getting food worth eating, even when on the run!  I love that these healthy little guys fit in my purse or pocket for a quick snack OR when I have to miss a meal."	4	1

That's how I found out it tasted good cold. When I finally was able to drink it hot it was great. Taste is not overly lemony, more like a lemon lollipop. I bought a pack of 6 boxes and will be getting ready to buy more soon (my girlfriend likes it too).	3	0

1	B0014WYXQK	A1X2LENOF84LCQ	a nice change	I like that the soda is made from fruit juice but it is misleading in that it is not all pomegranate, it also has apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and the last on the list is pomegranate. If you like a sweet soda you probably won't like this since it is very tart, I was surprised at how tart this was. It has a good fizz to it and is 80 calories per can, the cans are only 8.4 oz so it is smaller than other types but is refreshing. I would recommend this soda since it is a healthy alternative to other types of soda.	0	0

About two years ago she started to have upset tummy/loose bowel problems and was constantly on vet medications and eating grass.<br /><br />While on a shopping trip with my daughter to get her pet food I talked with the (Austin, TX) Tomlinson's pet store stocker and she recommended Wellness Small Breed adult health.  Within three days my dog's health was fine.  This food has no corn and weird ingredients so I think this dog food is the reason she is completely off all vet medications and has her health back.<br /><br />I'm ready to buy this Wellness brand forever.	2	0

I brought a new popcorn popper at the same time. I purchased this product. I don't think it is the new popcorn machine I purchased, it's this popcorn.

-1	B0038B39E2	A3R7HR0EK89C72	Good Breakfast Option	After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous about how this product would taste, but I found that when mixed with fruit and ice in the food processor it wasn't so bad. That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism. Overall, I like this shake as an option for breakfast it provides nutrients without weighing me down and tends to make me want to eat throughout the day, which is good for me because otherwise I wouldn't.	1	0

-1	B004D4T1ZY	A2X5OXPZ20UKA0	Good, but salty	We and our guests had wanted to try an authentic Virginia ham.  We ordered a Smithfield (large, bone-in).  The ham was 15 pounds (advertised as 13-15 pounds).  If a ham can be beautiful, then this one was, as we pulled it out of the oven.  We chose to use the 2nd recommended preparation method which was to soak for 24-36 hours and then roast.  The 1st recommended preparation method was to soak and then prepare in a steam pot (something you would see on a buffet line somewhere).  The ham was delicious, but very salty.  If I had to do it again, I would have soaked longer and changed the soaking water several times.  We are using leftovers in beans and in potato soup and letting the meat do the salting of the dish.	0	0

1	B000G6RYNE	A2L9028WTVFL1I	Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!	"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"	11	3

1	B008ZRKZSM	AIFRPH8W3VDE0	Awesome used for sauces / dips	While I think this is 'ok' as far as using as peanut butter (better than all the peanut butter substitutes I've tried, but still a weird peanut butter consistency), what it excels at is sauces and dips. Great for veggie dips. AWESOME added in at the end of a stir fry, to give a great peanut flavor and to thicken your sauce. It is outstanding some fresh udon noodles, a little black bean soy sauce, some stir fried meat and veggies (stir fried in broth, not oil), then add it at the end to thicken the broth/soy for an excellently flavoured and low fat dinner.	8	0

1	B000KV61FC	ALXV5YNZ3RTX7	Good toy	"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:55 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have a 43 pound border collie mix. He needs to be mentally stimulated so I bought this toy for him. He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber ""rope"" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt. It just gets dirty and hard to clean."	3	0

1	B004JRKEH4	A3FARCKMBHQZLY	OK, but Not Exceptional	I was expecting this to be a bit spicier than it is.  I won't go as far as saying it's bland, but it tastes a bit like a spicy ranch dressing.  The bottle describes it as being bold and creamy; creamy yes, but bold... not so much.  Nonetheless, it's a refreshingly unique taste and I found myself using it on a variety of foods.  And not necessarily only Mexican.  In addition to the traditional uses on Mexican dishes, I used it in lieu of mustard on meatloaf sandwiches as well as ham sandwiches.  The Chipotle Sauce added a different and pleasing taste to each.	0	0

-1	B000H1217M	A3CQ0EU1AKAZVN	Why dogs won't eat them.	My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over.	1	0
1	B004391DK0	A3QI9XJFXMATO4	Great for a few things	This mix is great for biscuits, snicker doodles and homemade chicken nuggets. But in our house that is all. We have been GFree for 3 years and yes, I have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make A LOT of GF stuff for EVERYONE. We LOVE the Pamela's baking mix for pancakes/waffles and sweetbreads and their flour blend THE ULTIMATE BEST out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes. But I will buy this mix (and yes, I do agree it is AWFULLY EXPENSIVE) for those three things I've mentioned and in a GF household, usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste. Not one flour does the best with everything.	3	0

I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months. Use good coffee. Marley's is packed in foil and tasted fairly fresh."	0	2

-1	B001ELL55I	A1HGXLP6WATS4B	Definately not what I was expecting	"I've enjoyed Jamaican Blue Mountain from the Amber Estate for a number of years but as its price climbed to at times over $75/lb. I had to look for an alternative.  The description of Reggie's Roast Panama Blue sounded like it might fill the bill, unfortunately, this was not the case.<br /><br />Top quality Blue Mountain coffees are most often given a light, mild roast which allows their nuances to gently fill your senses with an essence I can only describe as honeyed liquid gold.  Reggie's Roast Panama Blue is said to be a blend of Jamaican Blue Mountain and Panama Boquet coffees.  I suspect it contained very little of any Blue Mountain coffee, much less a ""blue"" from the top quality estates.  I found the roast to be darker than expected and the result was a somewhat coarse coffee with chocolate over-tones that had none of the light, bright honey notes I had expected.<br /><br />It was worth a try, but this coffee just doesn't do it for me."	4	0
-1	B0009YJ4CW	A1OQCYJYC3UB3W	Choking Hazard?	I have a 60lb Boxer/Cane Corso mix who is a pretty aggressive chewer. The only toys he hasn't torn to pieces are Kong and Nylabone toys. Aside from that, I bought him an Everlasting Treat Ball and was disappointed, especially for as much as it cost. He was able to start tearing the rubber apart, but that's not what concerned me at all. I was concerned about the treats that go in them. He was able to pop those treats out with one good bite, even if I put them in upside down, which is not fun since the treats get so slimy. I was concerned about him choking and the treats themselves are hard as rocks. I tried to break them up with a hammer, but they wouldn't break! I even tried to soak them in water and then break them up so he could at least eat the treats, but they still wouldn't break.<br /><br />If you have a dog who is not an aggressive chewer, then I think these toys would be great entertainment, just beware of a choking hazard if they can pop the treats out! For owners who have aggressive chewers, I would surpass this toy completely.	0	0

I also buy the flavored ones when we have guests and always receive accolades.<br /><br />But the cocoa roast almonds are still left in the jar after 3 weeks. Initially everyone said it tasted good and it is very healthy with almost no sugar. But then no one wants to eat much of it afterwards. They went for the dry roast or the barbecue ones.	0	0

-1	B0017T6S1I	A36TA71KLLS3HH	Ito En Tea's Tea Jasmine Green Tea, Unsweetened	"Bought this item 4/11 which was made in Japan. Simply Extraordinary. My wife and I liked it so much I bought 6 more cases (8/11) but this batch is made in Thaland. The bottle is slightly diferrent, without the green leaf emblem on the front as pictured. This new version is absolutely inferior to the original ones I had. Don't get me wrong, it is still good but I would not buy it even at the discounted price currently offered on Amazon. I have read other reviewers who suggested they changed the formula. Whatever it is, it tastes  strong like the regular cheap tea I usually get at the Chinese restaurants and the after taste is completely different. I almost wanted to return the shipment but didn't want to go through the hassles. Buyers beware<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted ""watered down"", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly."	5	0
1	B005VOONKI	AMRMK86X3PKXD	Nice Morning Cup	"I found the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee to be full bodied and rich. Pleas take the other reviews for what they are worth. Some of these people tried to steep these ""pods"" in hot water or use them in machines, and under circumstances, for which they were not intended.<br /><br />Pod brewers (like the Senseo, which I used)force hot water through the pod at pressure, similar to an espresso machine, just at much lower pressure. One pod is intended for a single 4-ounce cup of coffee. It takes two pods and a two-pod holder to make an 8-ounce cup.<br /><br />While taste is of course a very subjective thing, I found this brew to have a very rich and complex flavor. The pods worked perfectly in my pod brewer and made a very nice cup of coffee."	0	2
1	B005ZBZLT4	A3UCADC3198YOQ	Review for non-coffee snobs	"I like coffee but I don't have a palate that can differentiate between a coffee with subtle hints of vanilla, grass and one with ""smokiness."" I just know whether I like it or not. To me there's two kinds of coffee, the smooth kind and the kind that has a bite.<br /><br />I feel like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have a bite to them, something that makes them different. This Fog Chaser coffee is like that. There's something about it that makes it different and I think it's really good!<br /><br />The cups are not your normal K cup so I just got a metal tin and put them in there to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you do the subscribe and save on amazon, it makes these cups very affordable (for k cups).<br /><br />Overall, very good coffee."	1	1
-1	B0030VBRCG	A32DUBXXGA177J	Broccoli?	I feel mislead by the name of this product as the ingredient list on the package lists pears first then peas and then broccoli.

-1	B0026WL13U	A2908U1H9L3NGJ	These used to be so much better	Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.	0	1

We love it and buy it by the case.  It's the real deal, and I highly recommend it.  We top it with 'popping and topping' for more butter flavor, but many of our guests like it just as is.

-1	B0052XN0EI	A2SN61QOY0FL68	came open second time - stale - will not buy again	first time: I ordered this on a whim and so far it has worked out.  I have made it in both the air popper and the presto microwave popper and both come out fine.  I won't say it is the BEST I have even had but I bought some GV at WM that was pretty bad and had to use it up.  Other GV I had bought before wasn't as bad as this last batch.  This is SO much better than that or at least the first bag was.<br /><br />I keep my popcorn in the freezer in a sealed container.  It lasts longer that way - we did it as kids growing up and I have continued to do it.  So when I got the big bag, I put some in a couple of ziploc bags and put the rest in the Rubbermaid container I keep in the freezer door.  I keep a 3 T measuring cup by it and that amount works well fin the microwave popper.<br /><br />Getting 50 lbs at once would be too much for my limited freezer space.  I will stick to this size bag or smaller.<br /><br />I ordered this a second time - it came open - slit on the seal of the bag.  The second bag was STALE so who knows how long it had been open.  Amazon did refund my money for the slit open bag.  The popcorn was BAD and ended up being tossed.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.	5	1

-1	B000SATXPU	A3SYEXXMHAHB0Q	Changed ingredients equals bland product.	"I have been buying this product for well over two years and had been delighted by it!  Gluten-free mixes for the most part are horrible and this used to be exceptional not only in taste but in texture.<br /><br />To my great surprise and disappointment the ingredients have been reformulated. I recently reordered two cases of this mix; same packaging, etc. so no reason to suspect anything had changed.<br /><br />Well, as I was baking yesterday I noticed the ""new"" mix was a different color, in comparison to the ""old"" mix (I still had 3 older bags) and consistency when stirring was like mixing chalk powder in water.<br /><br />As the muffins were baking, the ""old"" batch mix was baking beautifully (nice golden brown) but in comparison the ""new"" batch mix did not appear to be baking (still pale white coloring after 20 minutes in the oven).<br /><br />So here's the scoop, the bag is now 13.5 ounces versus what was 16 ounces. There was no disclosure on the bag stating this major change.  In addition, many of the key taste ingredients have been eliminated such as vanilla bean powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The base ingredient was brown rice flour but is now whole grain brown rice flour (pale bland flour).  Now I know why the ""new"" product is bland! The taste is now gritty and in essence unpalatable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have one unopened case but will not be able to return it; Amazon does not allow food product returns. I believe the manufacturer should have disclosed all of these changes clearly on the packaging thus allowing consumers (like me) the option of purchasing or not.  If I had known the mix was reformulated I never would have reordered. Base cost per bag including tax is $4.84.  But keep in mind that your cost is slightly higher because you must add oil, sugar and any other ingredient i.e. blueberries, nuts, etc. to make the ""finished"" product.<br /><br />My recommendation, do not buy this reformulated product."	3	0
-1	B001EO5QPA	A2R4BNNO98V4A2	This is not premium quality tea	I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.	3	0
1	B003EM7J9Q	A2PN2CSU2WA49N	Great Product	If you like pork rinds, then you absolutely must try these.  These are pork rinds that basically pop like pop corn in the microwave.

-1	B004OV2Q5S	A3SZHL2TCTLJVR	Packaging almost impossible to get into...	I don't really like to write negative reviews, but I rely upon the reviews of others when I'm assessing items for purchase, so here's a summary of my experience with this product. While the flavor of this oil is okay (not nearly as great as I would have hoped based upon some of the Melina's reviews), the excruciatingly difficult and nonsensical packaging is enough to keep me from ever buying this again. Each individual bottle is quite small and then the narrow neck is covered with some kind of wax or foil cover that has no easy means of getting in--and as the top portion is so narrow that the only way to do it was to cut into it with a sharp blade, it would have been easy to cut myself. I finally was able to cut off tiny bits of the overwrap (which seemed to be a bit sick possibly with some minor oil leakage--perhaps from one of the other bottles) after about 10 minutes only to be confronted with a teeny, tiny cork jammed well into a narrow neck of the bottle with no gripper area or way to get the cork out. I tried two different wine openers with one almost pushing the cork all the way in... I was able to salvage it but then the cork was damaged so that attempting to close the oil bottle in any fashion that would preserve the rest of the oil is now impossible. I'm going to need to decant it into something else to keep it protected. The flavor--after the battle to get into the package was over, I'd have to say the flavor was good but certainly not outstanding. The battle wasn't really worth it--especially for the price.	0	0

-1	B000E8Y5D6	A2U2DUO80R4B6F	This is NOT EARL GREY in any way, shape, or form...	It's good tea, from a good manufacturer.  However, Amazon REALLY needs to re-label this.  It is ORGANIC GREEN TEA, with no bergamot, meaning, IT IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT EARL GREY green tea.  It's just plain green tea.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back as a return, so now I have 96 bags of plain green tea to go through.<br /><br />So, if you want good organic green tea, go with this.  If you want earl grey, take heed, and don't buy this.  This was my first disappointment with Amazon.	3	6

-1	B000CMFMFE	A1SVILVED8LL2C	Decent	"Soy nuts are never going to be anyone's idea of comfort food.  No one's ever going to come home at the end of a hard day and say, ""Man, I could go for a beer and some soy nuts!""  If you're eating these, it's probably because you're trying to find something to take the place of a much-less-healthy snack that you'd otherwise be eating.<br /><br />All that being said, these aren't half bad.  They are, as another reviewer noted, somewhat chalky.  You will want to have something to drink with these -- preferably water.  The flavor of these is pretty good, though.  Barbecue is the best of the various flavors these come in.  One problem with the soy nuts is that the manufacturer hasn't seemed to figure out how to get the flavoring powder to stick well to the soy nuts.  Because of this, a lot of the powder falls off, and the flavor has to be reasonably strong for you to taste it.  Barbecue makes it pretty well, whereas some of the other available flavors don't.<br /><br />Once again, these aren't bad.  I don't know if I'll buy them again, though.  I MUCH prefer Genisoy's soy crisps, which are genuinely awesome, and almost as healthy."	4	0

Besides, who really needs the carbonation?<br /><br />Now, as for the ""hunger satisfaction"" part -- I can't believe it, but it really does seem to work. Now, it is true that if I drank plain water before a meal, it would also kill my hunger. However, the taste of this stuff is so great that it really does satisfy my craving for something sweet. So, if this is ""science,"" ""magic,"" or my will to believe in the power of Crystal Light -- I don't know.

-1	B005NYXE8S	A1HI4GHMPIQ5YY	Fun Product but total cost (with cheapest shipping) exceeded $51.00!	The 60's decade box was well received and everyone enjoyed a trip down memory lane although a good portion of the products were unfamiliar not only to those raised in the 60's, but those older and younger.  Many were wondering if they were east coast products.  The price of the product for what was received was quite excessive, and the cost of the cheapest shipping was astronomical (almost as much as the product).  The box is cute, but some of the individual candy packages arrived opened with contents spilled and broken because it wasn't packaged for shipping.  Luckily I opened the box before presenting it as everything was piled together into a big heap.  I was quite surprised that there wasn't any box filler (stryofoam peanuts, bubble wrap or shredded colored paper) or that the items weren't arranged for giving.  I added my own shredded colored paper and arranged the items, but really felt for the price that it should have been professionally presented.<br /><br />Although a neat idea, I will not purchase any more of these decade boxes from this company for the reasons stated above.  I recently saw a similar item by another company that had just as many candies and was priced less than $15.	102	8

If you're wondering if they are worth the price, my suggestion is to buy one box and be amazed at the difference.  This can be the ""special"" tea in your collection.

My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all.

-1	B001BCVY9W	AF3BYMPWKWO8F	Please check the controversial ingredients and decide for yourself	"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one."	91	7

They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!	0	0

We tried several hairball control treats and these are the one our cats seem to prefer. I purchase one case every six months,giving the long hair cat 10 each day and the short hair cat 5 each day, and they do help to control the frequency of the barfing. They always arrive quickly and we will continue to purchase them from amazon. The long hair cat likes them sooo much he greets me each morning and bugs me until he get his whiskas.	0	0
1	B001EO5X30	AFY10LAKGZ184	Good to Drink Occasionally	I drink hot tea on most days and have found this one is tasty and sweetens other teas when mixed (I usually make 4 cups at a time & just use one bag of this in the whole batch). It really seems to help if I am feeling a little puffy or bloated. It has a very pleasant taste. The instructions for use are different from ordinary tea, so read those and follow them when first trying it or you might get mild diarrhea...it happened to me, nothing painful, just frequent trips to the restroom.	0	0
-1	B000H7CURW	A1RPR5ZK85KPDZ	Just Alright	Dave's Gourmet is probably the hot foods brand I hold in the highest regard so I was hoping that the Popcorn would be every bit as good as their sauces and Dave's Burning Nuts. Insanity Popcorn is spicy but without a lot of flavor. It lacks really much definition, its really buttery, or smokey. Instead its somewhat salty with a lingering heat. Its reasonably spicy but without insanely hot or great flavor (or both), its mostly novelty.  On paper it sounds like a great idea but I don't think popcorn is probably the best delivery mechanism for hot foods sadly.  Its not bad but its not great either. Other customers seem to love it to so buy and try.	0	1

This sauce is the exception. We could hardly eat a few bites. What a waste of a bunch of wonderful ingredients like scallops and fresh vegetables. The sauce is incredibly bitter and salty.	0	2

-1	B002P6FSVS	A334QC7ZCO4NCF	Whoa! HOW MUCH!?	I figured you could rip off the typical Anime freak/nerd/whatever but this is just dumb. These sodas cost a buck in Japan. ONE BUCK. And you'll selling it for FOUR!? This stuff is delicious, melon is my favourite, and these sodas aren't as sweet and full of unnecessary ingredients as American sodas are. Just five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, citric acid, and the artificial flavour of the product you're buying. That's it! Cute little 6.6 fl oz to boost (or you can buy the larger ones for like three bucks) and the marble is a cool effect, just a little confusing on how to open the bottle at first, especially if you're craving soda. This stuff is worth buying.........but not here. This is a total rip-off. Unless you're adamant about Amazong and willing to stay at home and pay for shipping and handling, and the greedy price for cheap soda, have at it. It's your money. Your call. I'm not the government telling you how you should spend your money. ........I just highly recommend you go somewhere else for your Ramune. Like Japan. Or a Japanese store. Not here.	0	2

Once brewed the smell it much lighter and not unpleasant. The flavor was ok, pleasant roobios flavor, however the cherry blossom part left something to be desired. Overall I am pretty ambivalent about this flavor and probably won't order it again. I have ordered other flavor teas from this company and enjoyed them very much. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNRJQ"">Tea's Etc 1000 Cranes White Tea, 8-Ounce</a>, for example, is spectacular."	1	0
-1	B001JH93BU	A20C4W03RFK0M6	The effect is barely perceptible and definitely not worth trying more than once	"My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q"">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the ""sweetest"" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends and don't expect too much."	3	1

Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious. My dogs love it! They seem much healthier since I've switched to this brand. The folks that sell this are wonderful.

-1	B003XDH6M6	A3C2CPTCMB7S4N	I did not care for them...	I generally like Newman's Own products and I like licorice a lot.  I am also a fan of Pomegranate so I figured these would be a home run. Though they are made with organic sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, they still tasted almost sickly sweet, cloying to me.  The texture was very nice and these certainly appear to be high quality, but I simply did not like the way they came together.	2	2
-1	B0030F3LCQ	ABF6W9HQVLQU7	WORST TUNA I HAVE EVER PURCHASED	I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst tuna I've ever had.  EVER.  I cannot even call it tuna, it is more like fish pulp.  It is a soggy mess of tiny flakes of very old-tasting tuna all mixed with water, and it is so mushy you cannot even drain it.  It is close to inedible and only good in the case of the Apocalypse or some other dire emergency.  I can't believe Chicken of the Sea sells inedible crap like this.  I would not pay 20 cents a can for it.  It is really not even good to feed to a dog because of the salt content.  However, I rinsed it as well as I could and fed it to the dog.  He seemed to think it was ok.	3	0
-1	B001CPUPMA	A1SM80KLE6QIMW	Terrible product	I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.	14	0

Can get the same deal at the grocery stores when buying an 18 count box for $10 and can even get the Green Mountain brand for that price. Good coffee though and I considered setting up the automatically times shipment to my house every month, however until it drops down to below 50 cents per cup, I won't.	3	1

Many of the spirals had broken down into...lumps. But, I stupidly figured it would be fine with sauce on it. It tasted like paste. Or, maybe envelope glue. Either way it was awful. My 2.5 year old ate about 5 bites, and that was more than anyone else. Thank goodness for take out Mexican food, I guess.

-1	B0039OVW74	A3JP4HJVBO0U14	No Acai BERRIES ! very misleading label - not healthy	Notice it doesnt say Acai BERRIES?<br /><br />That's because the interior of the candies are actually just a berry flavored gelatin - like the inside of a jelly bean. So these are just chocolate covered jellybeans, not real chocolate covered berries. Ingredients are fruit juice and fructose. Frankly it tastes like the main flavoring ingredient is sugar and cheap grape/apple juice to me. You cant even taste Acai.<br /><br />This product is intentionally trying to ride the healthy berries and chocolate bandwagon.<br />Yet it is full of unhealthy ingredients unlike what it label shows.<br />So this is NOT a healthy snack like they are trying to portray.<br /><br />If chocolate jelly beans are what you want thats fine, just be aware that the label is very misleading IMHO.	43	2
-1	B002T0IHPO	A3GD1VX6SQC6I0	Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days	"I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 ""regular"" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups."	1	0

-1	B0047S78TC	A2BXEYXJ08UA3J	Okay, but no cigar...	These just arrived, and I was first taken aback by how small the jar is (perhaps a squat half-gallon size), and it it is a scant two thirds full, not full to the top, as shown in the picture of the product (I am aware of the issue of settling, but trust me, you can't shake these enough to come close to the volume shown, in fact it is closer half full now). It is difficult to tell from a photo, but somehow I thought it was one of the large jars you you see in convenience stores; not even close. The silver dollar size is near accurate, each round is slightly larger than a silver dollar (this is a ground and formed beef jerky, not a natural muscle meat product, so the item size is consistent). The lid bears a large red label marked for retail sales at four for a dollar, which means that for the price I just paid ($18.82 for one jar), for the purchase of the entire jar, you are getting a bonus of about four of the little rounds off the full retail price if sold individually, or just under $.23.5 per bite size round. Curiously, there is a blank where it clearly shows the product weight should be listed, but I would estimate no more than a pound, tops. As to value for the price, I'd give it maybe two stars.<br /><br />This is a smoked, peppered beef jerky product, and I can see what appears to be pepper in the formed meat, but the flavor is quite mild on both counts. It isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about, either. In all fairness, I like peppered meat, so I was looking for very peppery flavor; if you like a very mild pepper flavor you might be quite pleased. There is no natural grain to the meat, so it is sort of an odd leathery texture(much like fruit leather does not retain the original texture of the fruit). To me, this tastes about like a less salty than usual traditional jerky, which usually has some pepper; but being advertised as a peppered product, to my tastes, it falls short. I would give it a three on flavor; it tastes alright, just not a great spicy, peppery jerky.<br /><br />Over all, it doesn't taste bad, and I'm not going to throw it out, but it wasn't what I expected, either value or taste wise; I wouldn't buy it again.	1	0

-1	B001EO5SCQ	A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ	Dry, Tasteless Jerky...	"* This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin' Teriyaki  flavor Beef Jerky *<br /><br />Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided"	1	0

The package says they're ""guaranteed to grow"" but says nothing about how to redeem that guarantee if they don't grow. Now I've spent over $20 on something that didn't even work. What a waste!"	0	2
-1	B001BCVY9W	A3H7AOFQDPU0JV	So Far the Kitties Aren't Buying It	"UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1/2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.<br /><br />NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1"" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the ""Snapper"" flavour.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."	3	0
-1	B000NMK4NI	A3LR79GJJ2JJWY	NOT PLEASED	the product arrived brown and dying and infested with some kind of bug.  I followed directions, looked up on line, talked to people.  the plant is nearly dead now having lost all it's leaves.  One could over look the ceramic pot that really is unattractive if the tree was healthy and thriving.  Unfortunately I don't know how to contact this company to let them know how dissatisfied I am by my first product purchased from them...I am not likely to buy from them again...	0	1

Milka has the artificial (Sucralose) and the Suchards has HFCS.  The Milka is pretty bland with very little chocolate flavor, while the Suchards is decent.  Although, I prefer having milk in my hot chocolate, I will stay with Suchards until hopefully something better comes on the market.  I will use the rest of my Milka for Mocha Capuccinos and leave this one for the ""Hot Chocolate Snobs""."	2	0

1	B0013A0NKS	A1SQ4IGWJQDEYU	I love the Stevita brand!	"I have found the Stevita brand to be the best with the least after taste because they use a natural process of amino acids to strip the Stevia leaves.  I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda, but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.<br /><br />I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners, such as the exotoxic aspartame- NutraSweet (the most poisonous), Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn't pass through the blood brain barrier), Splendia, Sucralose, etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes, what would you call a company who has developed anti-nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame, which is unbelievably being labeled as ""organic"". Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product, especially food, that is made in China, although it is nearly impossible to do these days, particularily if you shop at Wal-mart (the great Wal of China).  By the way, aspartame is a terrific ant killer and Sweet n low is rat poison.  I am surprised that they aren't used in chemotherapy.  I reckon these chemicals aren't expensive enough to use in ""medicine."""	4	1
-1	B004ZEL1BO	A2W0H4Q1UQNJVP	Dog loves 'em	I haven't had a chance to call the company to ask about overseas product in this, but I will.<br />I like these because it's easy to cut them into small training size treats.

1	B005VOONLW	A26I1PML9YALAW	"A Nice, Crisp Cup of Joe - Make you ""feel alright"" :o)"	I took the box of Marley Coffee pods to work for a group tasting.  The general consensus was that the coffee is very good - 4 stars!  Common terms used by my taste testing group included: light, hints of citrus, crisp, acidic, and brisk.  One close friend admired the clean taste and commented on how well this would go with a cheesecake or similar heavy dessert.  I couldn't agree more.  The pods worked perfectly in our office's Senseo machine, and we all enjoyed the chat and the coffee.  For the price listed, most of my friends, and I, agree this is well worth the cost.  Given that it's organic and free-trade, the cost is very good.  I normally only use coffee that is grown and traded under these circumstances.  I would highly recommend trying this coffee if you enjoy types such as breakfast blend from other coffee companies.	0	0
1	B001IZICO2	A1S130YJIBRFFI	Awesome!	This pectin works fabulously!  The directions are great.  They allow you to use little to no sweetening.

-1	B0045IK1CK	AW3ICG16VADMT	Awful	This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee.	2	1

-1	B000I1OLT2	ADNA24AADKBQ9	Not as good as I had hoped	I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.	12	1
1	B000W5SLB8	A1LADXNPI4UCAL	Incredible grain free food	"TOTW is one of the highest quality dog foods you can get.  I've been through many brands of ""top quality"" dog foods only to find irregular stools, low energy levels, and supplementing both of my dogs diets with vitamins, vegetables, or other items.  After my third round of research I decided to give TOTW a try, something that I can't even get a 30lb bag of in my local pet food stores.<br /><br />Both of my pitbulls love this food!  They drool for it while I'm fixing up a few bowls for them, and they haven't done that in the past.  One of them has an extremely sensitive stomach but was fine with the switch over as I followed the switching schedule on the back of the bag.<br /><br />I will say, after the dogs were on the 3rd day of TOTW one of my pitbulls start to show signs of detoxification.  She got rashy, her skin was hot to the touch, and she seemed miserable.  We debated stopping the switch of the food, but are glad we didn't.  After a few days of this she was fine, and her coat was looking better, her stools consistent and healthy, and her mood greatly improved.<br /><br />Our other pup had a very difficult time putting on weight since we had to heavily treat him for mange for over 8 months.  As some reviews have mentioned this dog food has quite sufficient protein and fat content, which helped him get back up to his normal weight as well as keep his coat looking shinny and soft.  The fat content shouldn't be an issue if you are keeping your dogs active as you should be!<br /><br />Bottom line: This food is extremely high quality, has great immune system benefits for your pup, is grain free (dogs shouldn't eat grain!), and will boost your dogs energy.  This is the closet thing you can feed your pup to a raw diet, without having to deal with raw food, and dogs love it!  Please, stop feeding your dog the major brands of dog food that will put your dog in the Vet's office.  Spending a little more on dog food will lower your vet visits and your dog will be healthier and happier after this switch!"	2	1
-1	B000EY38NI	AM68DFSTCHAE6	Delicious but damaged goods	As with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75% or more of the wafers crushed.

Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.	1	0

Oh, what memories this brought back from my childhood in England.  Even though I don't have many happy memories, this custard was my absolute favorite.  We'd have it in trifles, over cake.  I remember having it in school and now I can enjoy it here in my very own home.  If you grew up only knowing the American vanilla pudding, this is different - it has a much more delicate flavor which I prefer.  Well, I'm off to make a pound cake to accompany my custard.  YUMMY, YUMMY !!!  Ta Ta!!  UPDATE:  I refrigerated the custard and when I tasted it something was missing - that flavor of freshly made warm custard.  I decided to nuke a bowl of the custard for about 30 seconds and then stirred the custard - the freshly made flavor returned so I suggest you reheat the custard before use.	0	0

And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have ""best by"" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.

But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.

She now runs and plays again like when she was younger.  I love seeing her so ""lively"" again.

Yes, it is a good basmati rice, and being brown it is more healthful than that with the bran (nutritious exterior) removed: just what I'm looking for - BUT - yesterday the price went from right around $20.83 for one-time delivery, to [&#8230;]. That is very close to a 50% increase.<br /><br />I cannot know whether this is Amazon's choice or whether the supplier suddenly raised its price. But in light of the earthquake in Japan, a huge jump in the price of rice has the smell of nasty profiteering, since there now will be a need for countries with rice supplies to replace damaged goods in a highly-populated, rice-intensive nation. You do what you want, but for me the answer is to not encourage this kind of price gouging. In other words, I'm not buying. I'll look elsewhere.	5	4
-1	B004U43ZO0	A2M6B16568F7KH	Disappointed	I'm sorry to say I will not be buying these cookies. Upon opening the re-closeable packaging, I discovered the cookies were tossed around in their compartments as well as being broken and crumbled. I tried two cookies as did my husband and 12yr old daughter; none of us were excited by them.<br />I felt they had an odd taste - nothing at all like the regular Chips Ahoy and not the same taste as a homemade soft cookie. My husband who loves soft cookies also didn't care for them. My 12yo daughter liked the cookies but felt they were too small in size. The package has only 18 cookies meaning each only weighs a little over 1/2 ounce. I also feel they are overpriced - I will not pay nearly $5 for a small package of cookies - that's more expensive than Girl Scout cookies.	0	0

-1	B0058AMY5G	A1BXG0K7UD9CTD	They changed the Chips now they taste horrible	"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."	20	7

-1	B001LG940E	A36CTP2YSXLSFV	This is a small portion.  Too sweet not enough tang for Cherry soda.	While I liked this flavor much better then the watermelon strawberry it is still too sweet for carbonated fruit juice.  If I did not see black cherry on the label I probably would have not been able to guess this the flavor.  This is my favorite flavor of Switch they still need to amp up the flavor to be on my short list of black cherry soda.  The 8.3 oz can is a small size but considering the sweetness it is ample.	0	0
-1	B002PI82P0	A35J7TSBAIOIPH	Great Price for a Super Automatic	This is my second Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It's the lowest priced model available and is pretty good considering the price. The lack of extra features is not a problem. However there are some issues you might like to know before buying. Overall, it makes a decent espresso at the touch of a button. It's easy to clean and maintain and for that alone it's worth it since it saves you so much time.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso is decent - not bad, but not great either. It's far superior to drip coffee and easier than grinding your own beans. It took about a week to get the dosage and grinder settings to where I was satisfied. The defaults didn't use enough beans and the grind was too course which made the espresso quite bitter. You don't want run too much water through the grinds once the initial flavor is extracted.<br /><br />The temperature of the espresso is a little low. It's fine if you drink it right away or don't add cold milk. The only other little issue is the frother dispenses quite a bit of water before the actual steam. Therefore you have to use a second cup and run it for a few seconds until the steam flows consistently, then switch to your milk so you don't dilute it. Not a big deal but my last machine didn't require this step.<br /><br />Finally, the last issue has to do with the horrible packaging. The main box is contained in an outer box that's almost twice its size. The problem is there was NO PADDING whatsoever in the outer box, so the inner one is left to get slammed around throughout its entire shipping journey. My machine become separated along the main seam that runs all the way around the unit so it didn't even close properly until I pushed it back into place - there's still a small crack on one of the plastic pieces. Also, some of the buttons popped off. I would have returned it but it's kind of a hassle to ship something so large and it still works okay, so not a big deal, but wouldn't order one from here again.<br /><br />The bottom line is Super Automatic Espresso makers are an amazing convenience for those who appreciate fresh coffee. The quality is much better than the pod makers and far easier than grinding your own beans and making a whole pot at a time. The espresso isn't as good as a manual machine and this model doesn't have any fancy features, but still an amazing value for the price.	1	0
1	B000EDK60M	A35T8A43KFWD00	Strawberries? Blue strawberries that are round?	"This may be my own unique experience but I didn't have any strawberries in my cereal although I did find a few blueberry (freeze dried)pieces. And while I don't care enough to complain to Amazon, I may register a minor complaint with the company since this is a sign of poor quality control. Otherwise, I am enjoying the product. It's a mild blueberry flavor which complements the apples nicely. My guess is that the strawberry favor might be similarly mild but who knows? Though I have yet to open all the bags, a quick scan suggests that blueberries may be all I find even though they are all labeled ""strawberry""."	0	1
-1	B0030GOO5S	ALBU86BDTHS9C	Drinkable, but has chemical after taste	It tastes like it has an artificial sweetener or is sugar free. I wouldn't recommend it. But it will do in a pinch either by adding it to coffee or adding a flavored creamer.	0	0

It's just not MY cup of tea, as the saying goes.<br /><br />I was surprised at how sweet it is, and had to check the ingredients several times in an effort to figure out where the sweetness comes from.  As other reviewers have commented, it tastes a little like artificial berry flavoring.  There are no artificial berry flavors listed, but that's what the tea tastes like!  ""Natural strawberry flavor"" must be some special kind of potent.<br /><br />I couldn't pick out the rooibos flavor, though I'm sure it's under the stronger berry flavor somewhere."	0	0

-1	B000UVKX9C	A37AO20OXS51QA	Terrible artificial taste to it	Original Review (03-08-12)<br /><br />First off, I love and use regularly other Madhava products - both light and dark regular agave syrups as well as coconut sugar. I eat almost entirely organic foods and really needed a more affordable hazelnut flavoring for my coffee. Currently, I am using Flavorganics Hazelnut, which is EXACLTY the flavor I love, but I was looking for something a little more affordable.<br /><br />The taste is just off. And it isn't the agave. I love both light and dark agave from Madhava. It has a chemical or artificial taste to it and I couldn't do more than two sips of coffee to tell I needed to get rid of the entire 6-pack. I am going to see if Amazon will take them back, even if I have to pay shipping, because I think it is offensively bad.<br /><br />The Flavorganics has actual organic hazelnut extractives, which taste like real hazelnuts, like the ones in Justin's hazelnut nut butter.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Updated Review (03-10-12)<br /><br />I notified Amazon that I was extremely displeased with the quality of this product. Even though it is clearly not the fault of Amazon nor their responsibility to ensure I am happy, they went out of their way to make me an even happier customer than I normally am. I mean, we spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon, easily, and I think it is one of the best companies in the world. If we can't find it on Amazon or at Trader Joe's, then we probably don't need it.<br /><br />I still think this product is terrible, and I have always thought that the starred reviews should reflect ONLY the quality of the product, for better or worse. However, I figure the words of the review can stray from that requirement.	0	0

Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!"	1	1
-1	B002TMV3CG	A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ	Just a good coffee - nothing spectacular	We typically buy our coffee from Trader Joe's - it's economical, tasty and you can grind it fresh at the store. But we thought we'd check out this coffee from the German Melitta Group. It's got a good, strong flavor but there's really nothing especially memorable about it. If you're looking for a good coffee, there's really nothing to object to here - but there's also nothing to boast about. It's straight-up coffee. It's also surprisingly fresh for being pre-ground which is nice.<br /><br />As a side note, it's certified Kosher. I would think that most coffee would be Kosher, but after a little research it appears that's not something you can assume. So, if you're looking for a Kosher coffee - check this one out.	0	0

It is also very powdery, so it can leave little water holes in the grounds (which may make the coffee less strong).	0	0

-1	B0022N4D74	A2AFVUBR8VLUKF	Less flavor impact than liquid	I had previously used faerie's finest liquid raspberry flavoring with good results.  As many of my recipes require a low amt of liquid, I opted to change to a powder.  The powder is much less flavorful than the liquid.  The smell is not obvious (expected for powder).  However, this same effect carries over into the product.  The powder and liquid measurements are supposed to be equivalent.  However, putting in 1/2 tsp of powder resulted in minimal scent and taste.  I ended up using twice as much powder as liquid to get an equivalent effect.  The powder is a much weaker flavoring product than the liquid.  The taste is OK but does taste a bit more chemically than the liquid.	2	0

She took a liking to this food and eats regularly now. I actually mix half of Royal canin with 1/2 of the high tor neo and she seems to be doing very well and has gained her weight back.<br />  The product is supposed to be low in protein and phosphorous which is essential for cats with kidney disease.<br />  I give the product a thumbs up and so does Smokey my cat.

1	B000255OIG	A2EDWI5EGP4V9N	Really good treats for training	I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.	2	0

1	B0005YYHQY	A2MWRKME57F53V	Superlative store bought cookies: very hard to find!	"Buy these cookies. You will not regret it.<br /><br />They are, hands down, the best store-bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new brand that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).<br /><br />These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of ""new recipe"" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and ""soft baked"" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.<br /><br />In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.<br /><br />The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!"	7	1

-1	B006MONQMC	A1OMXVXXP07F05	I prefer Mio.	First off, let me say that when you see the bottle and realize that per serving is 1/2 ounce, you think this will last a long time.  However, for any real flavor (at least in my opinion) it took 2 significant squeezes to handle a standard water bottle.  With Mio I was able to get by with 2 squeezes, but the amount used was less.  When you squeeze on this bottle, it seems like a lot comes out.<br /><br />As far as the energy goes, I wasn't buzzed and flying around, but it did seem to help me through the afternoons where I tend to drag the most.<br /><br />The taste left something to be desired.  Even after 2 full squeezes, the flavor seemed very faint to me and not very fruity at all.<br /><br />All in all, just an average product, I like Mio more, but really wonder if this stuff is necessary in any fashion and that it may be better to just stick with my vitamins.	1	0

I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M.

It has a good flavor and is great for baking, frying, etc.  I even like the tins, and I use a can opening to remove the tops when the tins are empty and use them for cute storage.  The price has gone WAY up recently though, which is really frustrating. Amazon has a history of jacking the price up on anything that sells well or gets good reviews. I depended on my regular shipments for my cooking needs and now I need to look for another affordable replacement until Amazon puts the price back down in the normal range (if they do).	5	1
1	B000X9NRKS	A2VD05UT6B7RE6	My dogs love em!	I first found these about two years ago at Sam's Club, and being that I had two dogs that loved pigs ears I was interested.  My elder dog (now passed away) was getting up in the years and having a hard time with the regular pig ears and had lost all interest.  I got these, and she loved them.  She had a few teeth pulled but still could tear these up.  My younger, bigger dog loves them too.<br /><br />And I'll tell you this too.  My hubby forgets to close the bag properly (or simply doesn't notice, you be the judge!), and these things do stay soft for a few days (nay a week or so) even if you don't get it closed quite right.<br /><br />They don't last too long in this house, but if you want a good treat for your doggies give these a go.

1	B0018KR8V0	A1O97JT8IXKMFK	short on ingredients, long on utter deliciousness	These are my favorite variety of Larabar.  If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources.	12	0

1	B005GRCWDU	A3A1UXK2A34J9X	Been searching for good drip coffee	Yes i did say drip. I have now tried 2 different lavazza brands. This is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally. I will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up. If you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there. With other brands including starbucks i would use 1 - 1.5 scoops per cup. So in my 5 cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to 8 scoops. With both lavazza coffees i have found 3-3.5 scoops is ideal in my 5 cup maker. It takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does.	1	0
1	B000K8ESAU	A2FFYT9UB1EBJY	Necta Sweet - Good Taste, No Mess	Used this product before, then our supermarket quit carrying it.  Used the packets of yellow stuff.  Did not taste the same, spilled the packets, had to throw them away afterwards - it was a hassle.  Then I decided to check Amazon on the off chance that they were here.... and they were!!!!  At a WAY better price.  This product is so easy to use, tastes better than any of the other artificial sweeteners and is not messy.  Only down side is that it doesn't melt in cold beverages very well.	0	0

I received some a few months ago as a food gift.<br />I was unable to find it locally. I called the Quaker Oats Company to ask where I could purchase it and was told it was unavailable in my County. I was so disappointed. I went to Amazon.com and typed in the product name. Bam! There it was ! I was so excited I had to order a case of it. Buy it, try it, you WILL love it!	0	0
-1	B001JP7G4I	A3K5XRJR1UCP8Q	Nor pretty not effective	"I had mine setting in my den and my kitchen, the two places flies like to annoy me.  They've been set up for a week now and not one fly did they catch.  I would imagine that in a place where you have hundreds of flies flying around one would land on it sooner or later.  But when you only get up to 5 flies at any one time the trap holds no appeal to the fly at all.  And the topper is they paint dead flies already on the trap making it look even uglier.  What was the plan there?  The fly was to say to himself, ""Hey a dead fly.  I think I'll go land there to see what he died of."""	0	0
1	B0053DLPIA	A3KDO15P93WSLZ	Fast & tasty	My local Whole Foods doesn't carry organic pumpkin seeds so I came to Amazon.  I am very happy with this product and seller.  Shipping was free and extremely fast - I ordered on Sunday and received on Tuesday.  The pumpkins seed taste great and I really like the ziplock-style packaging.<br /><br />Nutritious and delicious; there are apparently lots of health benefits for pumpkin seeds; I primarily bought them because they are supposed to be one of the best foods to keep an alkaline pH.	0	0

-1	B0012TYZ4K	A3EGHMES7U169S	'Texas Taffy' Treats not safe.	I recently bought this Merrick assortment bag.

-1	B005CUU23S	A16WII7GKLVIFW	These things stink!!	I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it.	1	1
1	B000IHJEDE	A17MSWM9RUDKOX	They are a great crunchy, salty, low carb snack!	"These things are great if you're on a low carb diet, and I find them really satisfying.  If you're looking for some kind of gourmet cheese item, this isn't it; its a potato chip replacement that's more about crunch and a salty, tangy taste to satisfy an urge. However, I personally would eat them even if I wasn't on a diet! As for the amounts; each bag is only 75 calories!  So if you really want more, then open another one, but when you're on a diet, usually just one does the trick (see ""urges"" above)! They are more expensive than potato chips, but at less than a dollar a bag, you could do a whole lot worse! I've only had the ""classic white cheddar"" flavor and am trying a new flavor this week.  I'll let you know how it goes."	0	0
-1	B005K4Q4KG	ATVAXMCSYVATX	OK product...good for price	I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1/cup.

-1	B000KV7ZGQ	A2M18TY5BOC3OC	Too easy	I have a dachshund/terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.<br /><br />Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball.	0	0

1	B000X9NRKS	A2TVZOVDS85A5Y	Pretty Good for the Price	My two dogs both love pigs ears but I rarely buy them because they can be expensive and (I'm not sure if it is true or not) I've heard that some pigs ears are preserved with formaldehyde.  I decided to try to find a nice alternative to pigs ears and I came across Better Than Ears. The price was fantastic and I ordered a package of them right away.<br /><br />One thing I thought was great about the Better Than Ears was that it is a very clean and mess-free treat, it also has a nice aroma that my younger dog went wild for.  My older dog is a bit more picky about treats and she wasn't too impressed by the Better Than Ear that I gave her.  She just guarded it for a long while before she ultimately decided to eat it.<br /><br />The one thing that I am docking a star for on this product is that it doesn't last nearly as long as a real pig's ear.  The material is very soft and easily eaten and I was hoping for a treat that takes a little while longer for my dogs to eat, in the way that natural pigs ears do.  I've been freezing my Better Than Ears, which makes them a little tougher and last a little longer, but not by much.	2	0

-1	B001E4S8C8	A2W60CY9RS05NE	Sugar is natural	"If you are anticipating peanuts, salt and nothing else, this is not for you.  Sugar is a major ingredient as well as some type of added oil which I assume keeps the naturally occurring peanut oil in suspension (i.e., you don't have to stir this one to mix the peanut oil back into the peanut butter). Sugar may make this more appealling to the kiddie set, however.  If you are mixing true ""natural"" peanut butter, try using a hand mixer with a single blade; hold the jar tight, and mix away and in 30 seconds you're finished (unless you didn't grip the jar tightly enough, in which case you have to clean the kitchen, too)."	5	9
-1	B000GWLR72	A228P3VH7SFBHG	Meh	I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12.	1	1

If you're looking for a butter substitute for your popcorn maybe try it, but if you're looking for that great movie theater butter taste you should look somewhere else."	2	0

-1	B002T0NXK8	AA78TCLHXPJOK	"A fairly ""meh"" generic cola."	"I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other ""b-list"" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the ""kick"" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway)."	0	0

If, like me, you find Starbucks coffee to have a burned flavor, then this is better than some Starbucks blends, but it still has the signature burnt-popcorn undertone. To each his own, I say!	0	0
-1	B001BCXTGS	A3FS3FJPD3RJTD	Great Ingredients...If Only They Would Eat It....	I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.	1	0

I realize the 2nd stages are still a pretty thin consistency which is fine, but this particular flavor is REALLY runny.  I mean dripping off the spoon before it can reach her mouth runny. We also give her the Earth's Best My First Soups, and even they aren't this runny. I have to mix this with mashed potatoes or egg yolk, or even some baby oatmeal cereal to thicken it up.  The other 2nd stage foods they offer aren't as runny as this one.	0	0
-1	B000KV7ZGQ	A3RLO7U7WA53LB	Plastic Is Not Durable Enough for a Dog Toy	My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor. My dog is Jack Russell, so he's not dropping it from a very high height, yet it still breaks, so I can't imagine it with a larger dog. We have returned this toy twice, and already the third on is pretty much unusable.	0	1

I cancelled our order with caiman and tried to order thru AMAZON itself the same day Feb 3rd i believe. Here it is March the 20th. No nothing , just an endless extending wait. Apparently AMAZON & their sellers feel they can list items they dont , wont and cant stock. Dont waste your time. I just cancelled my order and bought it on E-BAY , it will ship tommorow. Forget Amazon, or unless you like being blown off endlessly by email with no LIVE person to talk to, then by all means order this thru Amazon (or Caiman!).

1	B000E46GG4	A1P3P9TXJ2ZEPC	Healthy breakfast made easy!	Love this oatmeal - whole grains, nuts, lightly sweetened.  Perfect!

-1	B0035AG4XO	A2QLCGKPHFODNF	Just ok-	Did not meet expectations.  I really, really love tea. Even when using 2 bags, there was very little chocolate flavor, if any at all.  The Hot Cinnamon Spice and the Earl Grey Supreme is a different story. I've tried most of the H&S teas, most of which are wonderful. This is among my least favorites as I enjoy most of their varieties however this one was disappointing. If you ever try the Green tea with coconut you must add honey and lemon and WOW major flavor explosion...without those condiments its very mild. Just a tip.	3	1

-1	B000M5NKUK	A3H9NI5FUXYATL	Leaves an after-taste	I applied this rub onto a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I smoked it for 10 hours the next day and the meat turned out fabulously. The rub gave a definite spice to the shoulder but I found it heavy on the paprika and somewhat sour with an after-taste. The ingredients were very straightforward and pretty much what you find in almost all of the rub recipes online but I think I'd prefer a little sweetness to complement the meat.  Next time I'll try mixing my own spices but it'd be handier to have everything pre-mixed.	0	0

-1	B000ZRXNRA	A22V3I98JS37SE	Should be much better	First of all, this is a 10% Kona BLEND, it is not 100% Kona coffee!<br />Second, it is a 7 oz. bag, which is less than 1/2 pound.<br />For the price, you would do better to go direct to the Lion Coffee site. So much for rarity.<br />As for flavor, it's not much better than cafeteria coffee. I found it lacking in aroma and flavor.<br /><br />Granted, the lion is a great looking brand, and it makes a cool souvenir to bring back to friends but, like the Macadamia nuts, it tastes much better in the islands. Save your money and buy a keychain instead. If you're looking for a nice Kona blend, keep looking.	3	3

1	B001BOVE54	AWQCNWWCN9WKZ	Great food, but not for the feint of heart...	My cats had a bad bag of another brand food, and refused to eat anything that tasted even remotely similar to that. One of them went from 13 to 8 pounds as we tried different things. This definitely did the trick. Described, it is the closest thing to wet cat food protein content in a dry food. It also smells, not like wet cat food, but definitely has a raw fishy smell to it, not exactly pleasant. However, they love it, and we haven't had a problem since. Be careful with portions, though, as this is without a doubt a food that your cats could get fat on.	0	0

I have tried pretty much every flavor of every brand, and Zico in the tetra pak is the best, doesn't have the weird aftertaste that some of the other brands do.  I like mango and plain OK too, but the passion fruit is my favorite.  Coconut water is not for those who are used to strong, very sweet drinks, but if you're looking for a healthier, better tasting water this might be for you.  And though it's out of stock now, Zico says it will be back in distribution later in summer 2010.  I can't wait!	0	0
-1	B001SJ1I58	A1AH8QNDS9NGAW	Horrible Dog Food	"We believe it's no coincidence after eating this food for a few months that 2 of my dogs started losing their hair and one died of having (0) blood pressure that was only 6 months old. They were ALWAYS so hungry, beyond normal. We got rid of it, gave it away. One dog eventually grew her hair back, the other one didn't. When you see the beneful food stacked up in Wal-marts you can appreciate what a mass productive product this is.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/03/2012: Finally after a few years one of our min pins started growing her hair back at (11) years of age after losing it a few years ago from this food. We fed her ORIJEN brand (6 fish) from Canada for a while then switched to something called Orgainix from PetCo (Made in USA) which is like $35 a bag, about the same price as the #1 rated ORIJEN. We now have 4 min pins with shiny coats that are healthy and playful.<br /><br />dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/beneful-dog-food-dry/ also rates this as one star<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), L-Lysine monohydrochloride, choline chloride, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Fiber (estimated dry matter content) = 4.7%<br /><br />The first ingredient in this dog food is corn. Corn is an inexpensive and controversial cereal grain of only modest nutritional value to a dog.<br />For this reason, we do not consider corn a preferred component in any dog food.<br />The second item is chicken by-product meal... a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It's made from what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered ""unfit for human consumption"".<br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything... feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs... anything (that is) except skeletal muscle (real meat)."	5	2
1	B005ZBZLT4	AJIOE2VBEFRWW	My new favorite	Tried it, loved it.  I like a bold blend and this one is great.  I really liked the new packaging, which works great in my Cuisinart Keurig machine.  It came in a box of 36, 3 sealed plastic bags of 12 each.  Stays very fresh in the sealed bags.  I put the open bag in the fridge to keep the coffee fresh (not sure I really have to bother doing that, but I do).  I'll try the French blend next, but Fog Chaser is definately my new love.	1	0
1	B001ELJK8C	A3UXQTU1J0C8PC	good value	I have made a number of these kits and the Zin Blush is my least favorite but the wife likes it so I made it again. The price and ease of making these kits keep me buying them. Let these age six months or so and it makes a huge difference. I really like the Tuscany Rosso and the Muscato to blend 50/50 but the Muscato is no longer available. Will try the Barolo next. I have dedicated a 6 gallon carboy to these kits and have one working all the time. I also let the wine bulk age in the carboy for a few extra weeks. Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't but I think it helps not to rush it to the bottle.	0	0

And really, my cats aren't that picky.  I'd mixed it with the remaining grocery store brand to introduce them to it slowly.  However, my cats pick out every single piece of the old stuff and leave the Wellness CORE behind.  I bet eventually they'll have to eat it, but boy are they NOT interested in it.	6	2

-1	B003SSU39O	A1VSTH048Y5SUY	Shipping almost doubles the price	Really looking hard for amaretto creamer for my husband who loves it, and thought getting the powder would make it last longer in the cupboard.  As it's an outside website there are no shipping discounts and when I put a case of 12 @ $35.00 in my shopping cart, I was informed the shipping was over $20.00. I cancelled my order as it's not worth it. A 3 case order cost $60.00 to ship and only gives an item price break of $2.69 per case. They need to get something set up with Amazon which gives a price break on shipping or there's going to be many more people who cancel their orders too.	2	0
-1	B003A199AI	ASK13URBE0LJH	blah	They are better than eating nothing, but they taste like lightly flavored air.  My husband and I were not impressed.  They were also pretty expensive.  We will never purchase them again.	2	0
1	B001EQ55RW	A1G60ANYI0HMEU	Heaven for low-carbers and almond addicts	Low-carbers who've experienced the make-or-break chocolate-craving moment can thank their lucky stars that these exist. Just when your will is weakest, a few of these extremely chocolatey treats can make a respectable substitute for peanut M&Ms. In a way, they're even better, because they don't make your blood sugar seesaw wildly.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the critical reviews of these almonds: They are not for people who hate Splenda. However, I don't find the amount of Splenda excessive. I find it just right. Most importantly, the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted. The cap also makes a handy serving size. I keep one canister in the car and one by my desk to ward off hunger pangs and candy cravings. And my 5-year-old son loves these and eats 'em like candy. He doesn't know they're good for him... that'll be my little secret.	1	0

I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their ""original"" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more."	2	2
-1	B005WWYY2Q	A1FPSHX2XVP8SN	Very Displeased	I bought these chocolate frogs as part of a surprise gift for someone and needless to say I am very disappointed in the size of the chocolate frogs.

I didn't get to open the packaging yet to see what the cards inside look like because it's a gift for someone else. I'd rather have waited to go to the HP Theme park and purchased a chocolate frog from there. The shipping charge was over priced considering the packages were not that heavy. Overall very displeased.	10	1

1	B000E1DS8Q	A4DMNCJGK1CHC	Jell-o Vanilla Cook & Serve, Sugar-free, Fat-free Pudding	It had become a quest for me to find Jell-o VANILLA Cook & Serve Pudding in the sugar-free, fat-free recipe, and NOT the Instant type.  I could find chocolate occasionally, but NEVER vanilla.  I like to use it not only for a lower calorie pudding dessert, but it makes delicious pies.  Use a little less fat-free milk, add a little cocoa powder, and it makes a yummy chocolate pie; or add some sliced bananas and a graham cracker crust, and you have a dessert you can serve to guests.  Or, what is really delicious is to add the cocoa powder AND the sliced bananas for a chocolate/banana cream pie.  Top it with some low calorie whipped topping and some chocolate shavings, and it looks like it came from your favorite bakery.  It's wonderful, quick and easy to prepare, and tastes great.  I had literally looked in every grocery store where I live and could NEVER find it, so I did an on-line search and there it was at Amazon!  And the price is very reasonable.  Thank you again, Amazon!!  In fact, the guests we had at dinner last night also thank you!	0	0
1	B0049ULB78	A2W9BX9RCAC4I8	Coffee house flavor for about 40 cents a cup	"I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or ""burnt"" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time."	1	0
1	B0000DG4MO	A3BSW4VRGF5ZYL	No Joke- Use with Caution	"I have had the same bottle of this elixir of the Gods for a couple of years now. After learning my lesson the hard way, I use it VERY sparingly as a condiment. When I first brought this bottle of thermo-nuclear liquid home, I decided to make a super-charged Buffalo Wing sauce. I proceeded to mix about a tablespoon of this in with some Frank's Red Hot (about 2 or 3 ounces)into which I dumped a dozen or so chicken wings hot out of the oil.  As I began eating the first wing, the sensation of heat was pretty intense. I was reasonably sure I had committed an error in judgement; after eating about 1/2 a dozen wings (and downing a couple of beers) I lost the ablity to see, speak or think clearly. Seriously, This is a great flavorful sauce with tons of heat.  Enjoy responsibly. Oh, and as others have mentioned, the ""secondary"" burn of this sauce is not to be underestimated."	3	0

They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.

Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.

-1	B000LKZEP0	A3EAGBWF121YVM	So-so	"I'm a vegan and have prepared a couple different homemade ""mac and cheeze"" recipes at home, and all of them ended up in the trash. I saw this at Whole Foods today and thought I'd give it a shot. Those who say it has a very strange odor and/or taste probably aren't familiar with nutritional yeast, which is one of the main ingredients and what makes it so strong-smelling. I added about 3/4 cup unsweetened plain soy milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons of organic Smart Balance (lower calorie earth balance, also vegan). I cooked the sauce in a separate sauce pan and added it to the drained pasta after it had cooked and thickened a bit. I also added maybe 1/2 teaspoon of mustard. Sauce was very creamy, but not big on flavor really. I ended up adding salt, cayenne pepper, and after all else failed, threw in maybe 1/3 cup of pepperjack daiya (don't usually buy that stuff either so it was lucky I did today!). After the addition of a little Daiya it was really good. It was relatively cheap for being a vegan cheeze product, I think like $2.00 or so. I will probably buy it from time to time, but I can't give something that came in a box a 5 star review when I had to add so much to it (and change the cooking instructions!) This is probably great for vegan/extremely lactose intolerant kids who haven't ever really had the Kraft stuff. Definitely better than the real thing nutritionally (well maybe not after I was done with it...)."	0	0
1	B007RTR89S	A1P77JG6PMRRPK	Gentle cleansing	I found this shampoo good for every-day use. It's gentle but cleans thoroughly. I tried it with its companion product, Clear Scalp Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner (how's that for a long name?) and found they work well together. The shampoo is a little less effective at adding body than some other shampoos, and overall I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. But I have very fine, curly hair that's temperamental, so another person might not have the same experience. All in all, I'd say this product is worth a try.	0	0

-1	B000CQ26EK	A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR	"a good example of how ""organic"" does NOT always equal ""tasty"""	"Oy. I found these on sale at a local grocery store and decided to try them, hoping they'd be deelish and I could start ordering them from Amazon. No luck.<br /><br />First of all, I should have known they'd be a bit. . .well, bland. The tomato  ""sauce"" is a product of water and tomato paste, which I normally wouldn't consider worth much. The sauce is a very light red color (more orange than red, really), very thin (by my standards, anyway), and an oddly bland sweet flavor that really did not light my fire. Of course, nothing canned ever stands up to the ""real"" thing, but this is, to me, beyond the norm when it comes to blandness.<br /><br />The ravioli themselves are very mushy and tend to separate as soon as I touch them with my fork. The bottom layer comes off, the cheese inside begins to mix with the sauce, and soon I have pasta squares instead of ravioli. A cheesy blandness rather than the original tomatoey blandness. Yuck.<br /><br />They aren't the worst I've ever had, but I was hoping I would like them more than the usual crap out there, like the Chef Boyardee ravioli (which actually taste good in comparison to these--yowsa!).<br /><br />I give this product a three because of the ingredients being organic, but man--spice it up a little, Annie's! Or at least, add some tomato chunks in there, or maybe use pasta that won't separate when you barely touch it."	7	2

-1	B000VKADQK	A3LG1P8JTSTK6M	Gives my dog terrible diarrhea	After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.	1	0
-1	B000JL3NU4	A32AI7AGARVBFS	Great presentation but inferior spice	I am not an expert on saffron, I was just trying to replace a bottle my mother gave me 25 years ago.  This saffron was not in the same league as my mother's saffron.  Flavor was weak and turned rice dish greenish color instead of the rich yellow/orange I was used to.  Maybe you have to pay more and concentrate on the quality of the spice instead of the attractiveness of the packaging.  Seller delivered product in timely manner. I just wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.	9	0

-1	B0047AJQHC	A257KGFGLWCYZ0	Disappointing arrival	"Cheap packaging.  Sent to my father and arrived in an ""envelope"" type box with a flimsy plasic bag that had apparently been opened already.  Disappointing as this was a gift."	0	0
-1	B003Q4H2DK	ARKCP44GJAYT4	ifficult to Use	This big bottle was WAY too difficult to use.  Even though I bought an accompanying pump.  The pump did not work well and I ended up throwing it away.  This sauce did not taste as good as good old Hershey's Extra Dark.  For this one, don't waste your money.  Just buy the Hershey's.	0	11
